    <h2>
      Chapter 1. Marseilles—The Arrival
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the 24th of
      February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the
      three-master, the <i>Pharaon</i> from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,
      got on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were
      covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to
      come into port, especially when this ship, like the <i>Pharaon</i>, has
      been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an
      owner of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic
      shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled
      Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but
      so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the
      forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened
      on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any
      accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down
      with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill,
      the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the
      pilot, who was steering the <i>Pharaon</i> towards the narrow entrance of
      the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye,
      watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the
      pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much
      affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel
      in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside
      the <i>Pharaon</i>, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station
      by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black
      eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance
      bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their
      cradle to contend with danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s
      the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man,—“a
      great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave
      Captain Leclere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that
      head. But poor Captain Leclere—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of
      considerable resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He died.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fell into the sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then
      turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the
      crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and
      outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail
      clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his
      orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the
      owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter,
      resuming the interrupted conversation.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

      <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/images/0023.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img src="./The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas [père]_files/enlarge.jpg" alt=""> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      “Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with
      the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.
      In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days
      afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest,
      sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six pound shot at his head and his
      heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of
      honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a
      melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years,
      and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more
      comforted at every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make
      way for the young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you
      assure me that the cargo—”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise
      you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:
      “Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a
      man-of-war.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails
      were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès,
      observing the owner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M.
      Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every
      particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship
      in mourning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which
      Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a
      sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his
      task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner.
      He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing
      countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates;
      and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which
      is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew
      as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the
      misfortune that has befallen us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest
      man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable
      service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so
      important as that of Morrel &amp; Son,” replied Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was
      watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor
      needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for
      our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require
      instruction from any one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with
      hate. “Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident.
      Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed
      the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and
      a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="./The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas [père]_files/0025m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0025m "><br>

      <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/images/0025.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img src="./The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas [père]_files/enlarge.jpg" alt=""> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      “As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that
      was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off
      the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you
      are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the
      pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man,
      “come this way!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with
      you.” Then calling to the crew, he said—“Let go!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the
      port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the
      pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast
      the colors, and square the yards!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain
      already, upon my word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he
      is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full
      experience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow. “Your pardon, M. Morrel,”
      said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am
      at your service. You hailed me, I think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you
      stopped at the Island of Elba?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of
      Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then did you see him, Edmond?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The marshal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said
      suddenly—“And how is the emperor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You saw the emperor, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you spoke to him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did he say to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles,
      the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had
      not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I
      told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel
      &amp; Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels
      have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served
      in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu!</i>, and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly
      delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was
      afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor
      remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s
      eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder
      kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s
      instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had
      conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it
      might bring you into trouble.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès;
      “for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor
      merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me,
      here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.”
      And the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars
      approached, and said,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his
      landing at Porto-Ferrajo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it
      is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is
      not saying much. It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from
      him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me?—no—was there one?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a
      letter to his care.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars turned very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which
      was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but
      if there be any letter he will give it to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,”
      said he, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have
      been mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have not been long detained.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading;
      and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I
      gave them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you have nothing more to do here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No—everything is all right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you can come and dine with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is
      due to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have
      done me.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you
      know how my father is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your
      absence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal
      left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from
      Heaven.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit
      has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who
      expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely
      Mercédès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least
      surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any
      news of the <i>Pharaon</i>. <i>Peste!</i>, Edmond, you have a very
      handsome mistress!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely;
      “she is my betrothed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t
      let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to
      allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’
      wages.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say I have a poor father, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see
      your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who
      detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I have your leave, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask
      your leave of absence for some days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To get married?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite
      six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until
      three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the <i>Pharaon</i>,”
      added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail
      without her captain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with
      animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most
      secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain
      of the <i>Pharaon</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear
      Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the
      Italian proverb—<i>Chi ha compagno ha padrone</i>—‘He
      who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half
      done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you the
      other; I will do my best.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his
      eyes, and grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you
      in the name of my father and of Mercédès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that
      watches over the deserving. Go to your father: go and see Mercédès, and
      afterwards come to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I row you ashore?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with
      Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do
      you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the
      day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to
      him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the
      dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite
      right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the
      question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will
      be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the <i>Pharaon</i>
      should you be glad to see Danglars remain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest
      respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a
      thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how
      impatient you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I have leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, I tell you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “May I have the use of your skiff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets,
      with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two oarsmen bent
      to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in
      the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which
      leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the
      Quai d’Orléans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring
      out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five
      o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in
      the famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern
      Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and
      with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If
      Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On
      turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting
      orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was
      a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the
      movements of Edmond Dantès.

    </h2>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e will leave
      Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and endeavoring to insinuate
      in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade, and
      follow Dantès, who, after having traversed La Canebière, took the Rue de
      Noailles, and entering a small house, on the left of the Allées de
      Meillan, rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase, holding the
      baluster with one hand, while with the other he repressed the beatings of
      his heart, and paused before a half-open door, from which he could see the
      whole of a small room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This room was occupied by Dantès’ father. The news of the arrival of
      the <i>Pharaon</i> had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a
      chair, was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums
      and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.
      Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice
      behind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he fell
      into his arms, pale and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?” inquired the
      young man, much alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I
      did not expect you; and joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah,
      I feel as if I were going to die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ‘Tis I—really I!
      They say joy never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come
      now, do smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again,
      and we are going to be happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will,” replied the
      old man; “but how shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again?
      Come, tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at
      happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not
      seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to
      lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable
      that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you
      understand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred
      louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor sailor
      like me could have hoped for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very
      fortunate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a
      small house, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and
      honeysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and
      as he said so the old man’s strength failed him, and he fell
      backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come,” said the young man, “a glass of wine,
      father, will revive you. Where do you keep your wine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,”
      said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,” and he opened two or
      three cupboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is no use,” said the old man, “there is no wine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, no wine?” said Dantès, turning pale, and looking
      alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards.
      “What, no wine? Have you wanted money, father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yet,” stammered Dantès, wiping the perspiration from his
      brow,—“yet I gave you two hundred francs when I left, three
      months ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a
      little debt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me
      if I did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see,
      lest he might do you an injury”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, I paid him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” cried Dantès, “it was a hundred and forty francs
      I owed Caderousse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” stammered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,”
      muttered Edmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know how little I require,” said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heaven pardon me,” cried Edmond, falling on his knees before
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have wounded me to the heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind it, for I see you once more,” said the old man;
      “and now it’s all over—everything is all right again.”

      “Yes, here I am,” said the young man, “with a promising
      future and a little money. Here, father, here!” he said, “take
      this—take it, and send for something immediately.” And he
      emptied his pockets on the table, the contents consisting of a dozen gold
      pieces, five or six five-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The
      countenance of old Dantès brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whom does this belong to?” he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and
      tomorrow we shall have more.”

      by your leave I will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if
      they saw me buy too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to
      await your return, in order to be able to purchase them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I
      will not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and most
      capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall have
      tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt
      comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,”
      murmured Edmond. “But, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us
      a service on a time, so he’s welcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the
      door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth,
      which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, is it you, Edmond, back again?” said he, with a broad
      Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to
      you in any and every way,” replied Dantès, but ill-concealing his
      coldness under this cloak of civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything;
      and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.”
      Dantès made a gesture. “I do not allude to you, my boy. No!—no!
      I lent you money, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors,
      and we are quits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’
      reply; “for when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let
      us talk of your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a
      piece of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ‘You at
      Marseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but
      am now back again.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. And
      so I came,” added Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the
      pleasure of shaking hands with a friend.”

    <p>
      “Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much
      attached to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks
      are so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,”
      continued the tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver
      which Dantès had thrown on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of
      his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is
      not mine. I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many
      things in my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the
      table. Come, father” added Dantès, “put this money back in
      your box—unless neighbor Caderousse wants anything, and in that case
      it is at his service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any
      want, thank God, my living is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep
      it, I say;—one never has too much;—but, at the same time, my
      boy, I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I
      hear,—you insinuating dog, you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied
      Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès;
      “and did he invite you to dine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s
      astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,”
      replied the young man. “I was most anxious to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said
      Caderousse. “And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was
      wrong to annoy the owner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied
      Dantès, “and I hope he fully understood it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s
      patrons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the better—so much the better! Nothing will give
      greater pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind
      the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercédès?” said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you,
      and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to
      go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès: “and heaven bless
      you in your wife, as it has blessed me in my son!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on,
      father Dantès; she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but according to all probability she soon will be,”
      replied Edmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to
      return as soon as possible, my boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack
      followers; she particularly has them by dozens.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces
      of slight uneasiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers,
      too; but you know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but
      ill-concealed his trouble, “that if I were not a captain”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come,” said the sailor, “I have a better opinion
      than you of women in general, and of Mercédès in particular; and I am
      certain that, captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the better—so much the better,” said
      Caderousse. “When one is going to be married, there is nothing like
      implicit confidence; but never mind that, my boy,—go and announce
      your arrival, and let her know all your hopes and prospects.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will go directly,” was Edmond’s reply; and, embracing
      his father, and nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old Dantès, he went
      downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of the Rue
      Senac.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Danglars, “did you see him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have just left him,” answered Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did he allude to his hope of being captain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He spoke of it as a thing already decided.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed!” said Danglars, “he is in too much hurry, it
      appears to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that he is quite elated about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter—has already
      offered me his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered
      me a loan of money, as though he were a banker.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which you refused?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it
      was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M.
      Dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance—he is about to
      become a captain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pooh!” said Danglars, “he is not one yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi!</i> it will be as well if he is not,” answered
      Caderousse; “for if he should be, there will be really no speaking
      to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If we choose,” replied Danglars, “he will remain what
      he is; and perhaps become even less than he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing—I was speaking to myself. And is he still in love
      with the Catalane?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Over head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a
      storm in that quarter.”

      “Explain yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why should I?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like
      Dantès?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never like upstarts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then tell me all you know about the Catalane.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me
      to believe, as I told you, that the future captain will find some
      annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What have you seen?—come, tell me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has
      been accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red
      complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one
      mean with a fine wench of seventeen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He went before I came down.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us go the same way; we will stop at La Réserve, and we can
      drink a glass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come along,” said Caderousse; “but you pay the score.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course,” replied Danglars; and going quickly to the
      designated place, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Père Pamphile had seen Dantès pass not ten minutes before; and assured
      that he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of
      the planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were singing
      their welcome to one of the first days of spring.

      Chapter 3. The Catalans
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>eyond a bare,
      weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot where the two
      friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine, was the
      village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony quitted Spain,
      and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day. Whence it
      came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of its chiefs, who
      understood Provençal, begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this
      bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors of old, they had run
      their boats ashore. The request was granted; and three months afterwards,
      around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies
      of the sea, a small village sprang up. This village, constructed in a
      singular and picturesque manner, half Moorish, half Spanish, still
      remains, and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers, who speak
      the language of their fathers. For three or four centuries they have
      remained upon this small promontory, on which they had settled like a
      flight of seabirds, without mixing with the Marseillaise population,
      intermarrying, and preserving their original customs and the costume of
      their mother-country as they have preserved its language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village,
      and enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the beautiful
      dead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and within
      coated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and beautiful girl,
      with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle’s, was
      leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender
      delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of which
      she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms, bare to the
      elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved with a
      kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her arched and
      supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned
      leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking. At three paces
      from her, seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs, leaning his
      elbow on an old worm-eaten table, was a tall young man of twenty, or
      two-and-twenty, who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and
      uneasiness were mingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and
      steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see, Mercédès,” said the young man, “here is Easter
      come round again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must
      be very stupid to ask me again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, repeat it,—repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last
      believe it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which
      had your mother’s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you
      are trifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.
      Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and to
      lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope,
      Fernand,” replied Mercédès; “you cannot reproach me with the
      slightest coquetry. I have always said to you, ‘I love you as a
      brother; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart
      is another’s.’ Is not this true, Fernand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,” replied the young man,
      “Yes, you have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it
      is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?”

    <p>
      “You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I
      pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in
      the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable
      at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier, what
      would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune, with
      nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable
      inheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She
      has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost
      entirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and
      that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I
      accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother,
      because we were brought up together, and still more because it would give
      you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this fish which
      I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spin,—I
      feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as
      well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of
      Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful
      housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman
      becomes a bad manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman,
      when she loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my
      friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will
      promise no more than I can bestow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I understand,” replied Fernand, “you can endure your
      own wretchedness patiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well,
      Mercédès, beloved by you, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good
      luck, and I should become rich. I could extend my occupation as a
      fisherman, might get a place as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a
      dealer myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you
      remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a
      fisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I will do better, Mercédès. I will be a sailor; instead of
      the costume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished
      hat, a striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.
      Would not that dress please you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean?” asked Mercédès, with an angry glance,—“what
      do you mean? I do not understand you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean, Mercédès, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me,
      because you are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom
      you await is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fernand,” cried Mercédès, “I believed you were
      good-hearted, and I was mistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your
      aid jealousy and the anger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await,
      and I do love him of whom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead
      of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you
      that he died loving me and me only.” The young girl made a gesture
      of rage. “I understand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him
      because I do not love you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his
      dirk. What end would that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were
      conquered, and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor.
      Believe me, to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the
      woman who loves that man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil
      thoughts. Unable to have me for your wife, you will content yourself with
      having me for your friend and sister; and besides,” she added, her
      eyes troubled and moistened with tears, “wait, wait, Fernand; you
      said just now that the sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four
      months, and during these four months there have been some terrible storms.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed
      down the cheeks of Mercédès, although for each of these tears he would
      have shed his heart’s blood; but these tears flowed for another. He
      arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly stopping
      before Mercédès, with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched,—“Say,
      Mercédès,” he said, “once for all, is this your final
      determination?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I love Edmond Dantès,” the young girl calmly replied, “and
      none but Edmond shall ever be my husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you will always love him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As long as I live.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was like
      a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with clenched
      teeth and expanded nostrils, said,—“But if he is dead——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he is dead, I shall die too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he has forgotten you——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercédès!” called a joyous voice from without,—“Mercédès!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and
      fairly leaping in excess of love, “you see he has not forgotten me,
      for here he is!” And rushing towards the door, she opened it,
      saying, “Here, Edmond, here I am!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight of a
      serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and Mercédès were
      clasped in each other’s arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which shot
      into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of light.
      At first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness isolated
      them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in broken words,
      which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the
      expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale, and
      threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the shadow. By a
      movement for which he could scarcely account to himself, the young Catalan
      placed his hand on the knife at his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, your pardon,” said Dantès, frowning in his turn; “I
      did not perceive that there were three of us.” Then, turning to
      Mercédès, he inquired, “Who is this gentleman?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One who will be your best friend, Dantès, for he is my friend, my
      cousin, my brother; it is Fernand—the man whom, after you, Edmond, I
      love the best in the world. Do you not remember him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes!” said Dantès, and without relinquishing Mercédès hand
      clasped in one of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a
      cordial air. But Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture,
      remained mute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at
      the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès, and then again on the gloomy and
      menacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to
      meet an enemy here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An enemy!” cried Mercédès, with an angry look at her cousin.
      “An enemy in my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I
      would place my arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the
      house to return to it no more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand’s eye darted lightning. “And should any misfortune
      occur to you, dear Edmond,” she continued with the same calmness
      which proved to Fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost
      depths of his sinister thought, “if misfortune should occur to you,
      I would ascend the highest point of the Cape de Morgion and cast myself
      headlong from it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand became deadly pale. “But you are deceived, Edmond,”
      she continued. “You have no enemy here—there is no one but
      Fernand, my brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan,
      who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and offered him
      his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave, was broken
      against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised over him. Scarcely,
      however, had he touched Edmond’s hand than he felt he had done all
      he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair—“Oh,
      who will deliver me from this man? Wretched—wretched that I am!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?”
      exclaimed a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived
      Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well”, said Caderousse, “why don’t you come? Are
      you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day
      with your friends?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,”
      added Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did
      not say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He seems besotted,” said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with
      his knee. “Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all
      we have believed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s
      reply; and turning towards the young man, said, “Well, Catalan, can’t
      you make up your mind?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly
      entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to
      his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-day,” said he. “You called me, didn’t you?”
      And he fell, rather than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was
      afraid you would throw yourself into the sea,” said Caderousse,
      laughing. “Why, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer
      him a glass of wine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or
      four pints of water unnecessarily!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into his
      hands, his elbows leaning on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Fernand, I must say,” said Caderousse, beginning the
      conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity
      destroys all diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like a rejected lover;”
      and he burst into a hoarse laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah!” said Danglars, “a lad of his make was not born to
      be unhappy in love. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” he replied, “only hark how he sighs! Come, come,
      Fernand,” said Caderousse, “hold up your head, and answer us.
      It’s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My health is well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands
      without raising his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you see, Danglars,” said Caderousse, winking at his
      friend, “this is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good
      and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in
      love with a very fine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately,
      that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the <i>Pharaon</i>; and as
      the <i>Pharaon</i> arrived today—why, you understand!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; I do not understand,” said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor Fernand has been dismissed,” continued Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, and what then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and
      looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his
      anger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she
      not free to love whomsoever she will?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said Caderousse, “it
      is another thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the
      Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It
      was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand smiled piteously. “A lover is never terrible,” he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor fellow!” remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young
      man from the bottom of his heart. “Why, you see, he did not expect
      to see Dantès return so suddenly—he thought he was dead, perhaps; or
      perchance faithless! These things always come on us more severely when
      they come suddenly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, <i>ma foi</i>, under any circumstances,” said Caderousse,
      who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take
      effect,—“under any circumstances Fernand is not the only
      person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, you are right—and I should say that would bring him
      ill-luck.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, never mind,” answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass
      of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time,
      while Danglars had merely sipped his. “Never mind—in the
      meantime he marries Mercédès—the lovely Mercédès—at least he
      returns to do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on
      whose heart Caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when is the wedding to be?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is not yet fixed!” murmured Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as
      Dantès will be captain of the <i>Pharaon</i>—eh, Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse,
      whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was
      premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already
      rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said he, filling the glasses, “let us drink to
      Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed
      the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eh, eh, eh!” stammered Caderousse. “What do I see down
      there by the wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your
      eyes are better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a
      deceiver; but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and
      hand in hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them,
      and they are actually embracing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know them, Fernand?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” was the reply, in a low voice. “It is Edmond and
      Mercédès!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, see there, now!” said Caderousse; “and I did not
      recognize them! Hallo, Dantès! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and
      let us know when the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he
      will not tell us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hold your tongue, will you?” said Danglars, pretending to
      restrain Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of
      the arbor. “Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love
      without interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is
      well-behaved!”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the bull
      is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his
      seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival,
      when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked
      at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this Fernand recollected her
      threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again heavily on his seat.
      Danglars looked at the two men, one after the other, the one brutalized by
      liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall get nothing from these fools,” he muttered; “and
      I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. Here’s
      an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing
      his wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from
      under his nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes
      that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and
      Calabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow.
      Unquestionably, Edmond’s star is in the ascendant, and he will marry
      the splendid girl—he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all,
      unless”—a sinister smile passed over Danglars’ lips—“unless
      I take a hand in the affair,” he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hallo!” continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist
      on the table, “hallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are
      you too proud to speak to them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my dear fellow!” replied Dantès, “I am not proud,
      but I am happy, and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, very well, that’s an explanation!” said Caderousse.
      “How do you do, Madame Dantès?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercédès courtesied gravely, and said—“That is not my name,
      and in my country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by
      the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me
      Mercédès, if you please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,” said Dantès,
      “he is so easily mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dantès,”
      said Danglars, bowing to the young couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be
      arranged at my father’s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the
      wedding festival here at La Réserve. My friends will be there, I hope;
      that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And Fernand,” said Caderousse with a chuckle; “Fernand,
      too, is invited!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My wife’s brother is my brother,” said Edmond; “and
      we, Mercédès and I, should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and he
      could not utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Today the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are
      in a hurry, captain!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Danglars,” said Edmond, smiling, “I will say to you as
      Mercédès said just now to Caderousse, ‘Do not give me a title which
      does not belong to me’; that may bring me bad luck.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your pardon,” replied Danglars, “I merely said you
      seemed in a hurry, and we have lots of time; the <i>Pharaon</i> cannot be
      under weigh again in less than three months.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have
      suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good
      fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I
      must go to Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, really?—to Paris! and will it be the first time you have
      ever been there, Dantès?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you business there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you
      know to what I allude, Danglars—it is sacred. Besides, I shall only
      take the time to go and return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, I understand,” said Danglars, and then in a low
      tone, he added, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the
      grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea—a capital
      idea! Ah; Dantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on
      board the good ship <i>Pharaon</i>;” then turning towards Edmond,
      who was walking away, “A pleasant journey,” he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two
      lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very
      elect of heaven.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>anglars followed
      Edmond and Mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind
      one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas, then turning round, he perceived
      Fernand, who had fallen, pale and trembling, into his chair, while
      Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my dear sir,” said Danglars to Fernand, “here is
      a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It drives me to despair,” said Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you, then, love Mercédès?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I adore her!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For long?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As long as I have known her—always.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy
      your condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would you have me do?” said Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle
      Mercédès; but for you—in the words of the gospel, seek, and you
      shall find.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have found already.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune
      happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pooh! Women say those things, but never do them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not know Mercédès; what she threatens she will do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Idiot!” muttered Danglars; “whether she kill herself or
      not, what matter, provided Dantès is not captain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before Mercédès should die,” replied Fernand, with the
      accents of unshaken resolution, “I would die myself!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s what I call love!” said Caderousse with a voice
      more tipsy than ever. “That’s love, or I don’t know what
      love is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said Danglars, “you appear to me a good sort of
      fellow, and hang me, I should like to help you, but”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Caderousse, “but how?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow,” replied Danglars, “you are three parts
      drunk; finish the bottle, and you will be completely so. Drink then, and
      do not meddle with what we are discussing, for that requires all one’s
      wit and cool judgment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I—drunk!” said Caderousse; “well that’s a
      good one! I could drink four more such bottles; they are no bigger than
      cologne flasks. Père Pamphile, more wine!” and Caderousse rattled
      his glass upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were saying, sir”—said Fernand, awaiting with great
      anxiety the end of this interrupted remark.

      “What was I saying? I forget. This drunken Caderousse has made me
      lose the thread of my sentence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Drunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for
      it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will
      extract from their hearts;” and Caderousse began to sing the two
      last lines of a song very popular at the time,—
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tous les méchants sont beuveurs d’eau; C’est bien
      prouvé par le déluge.’ [*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * “The wicked are great drinkers of water; As the flood proved once for all.”
 </pre>
    <p>
      “You said, sir, you would like to help me, but”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but I added, to help you it would be sufficient that Dantès
      did not marry her you love; and the marriage may easily be thwarted,
      methinks, and yet Dantès need not die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Death alone can separate them,” remarked Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You talk like a noodle, my friend,” said Caderousse; “and
      here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove
      to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you.
      Say there is no need why Dantès should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he
      should. Dantès is a good fellow; I like Dantès. Dantès, your health.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand rose impatiently. “Let him run on,” said Danglars,
      restraining the young man; “drunk as he is, he is not much out in
      what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a
      prison were between Edmond and Mercédès they would be as effectually
      separated as if he lay under a tombstone.”

    <p>
      “Yes; but one gets out of prison,” said Caderousse, who, with
      what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, “and
      when one gets out and one’s name is Edmond Dantès, one seeks revenge”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “What matters that?” muttered Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why, I should like to know,” persisted Caderousse,
      “should they put Dantès in prison? he has not robbed or killed or
      murdered.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hold your tongue!” said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I won’t hold my tongue!” replied Caderousse; “I
      say I want to know why they should put Dantès in prison; I like Dantès;
      Dantès, your health!” and he swallowed another glass of wine.

    <p>
      Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his
      intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, “Well, you
      understand there is no need to kill him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of
      having Dantès arrested. Have you that means?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the
      matter? it is no affair of mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know not why you meddle,” said Fernand, seizing his arm;
      “but this I know, you have some motive of personal hatred against
      Dantès, for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of
      others.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I!—motives of hatred against Dantès? None, on my word! I saw
      you were unhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; that’s all;
      but since you believe I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get
      out of the affair as best you may;” and Danglars rose as if he meant
      to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” said Fernand, restraining him, “stay! It is of
      very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have
      any angry feeling or not against Dantès. I hate him! I confess it openly.
      Do you find the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the
      man, for Mercédès has declared she will kill herself if Dantès is killed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and
      looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said,—“Kill
      Dantès! who talks of killing Dantès? I won’t have him killed—I
      won’t! He’s my friend, and this morning offered to share his
      money with me, as I shared mine with him. I won’t have Dantès killed—I
      won’t!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?”
      replied Danglars. “We were merely joking; drink to his health,”
      he added, filling Caderousse’s glass, “and do not interfere
      with us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, Dantès’ good health!” said Caderousse,
      emptying his glass, “here’s to his health! his health—hurrah!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the means—the means?” said Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you not hit upon any?” asked Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No!—you undertook to do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” replied Danglars; “the French have the
      superiority over the Spaniards, that the Spaniards ruminate, while the
      French invent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you invent, then,” said Fernand impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Waiter,” said Danglars, “pen, ink, and paper.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pen, ink, and paper,” muttered Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and
      without my tools I am fit for nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pen, ink, and paper, then,” called Fernand loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s what you want on that table,” said the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bring them here.” The waiter did as he was desired.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    <p>
      “When one thinks,” said Caderousse, letting his hand drop on
      the paper, “there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than
      if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him! I have always had
      more dread of a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a
      sword or pistol.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,” said
      Danglars. “Give him some more wine, Fernand.” Fernand filled
      Caderousse’s glass, who, like the confirmed toper he was, lifted his
      hand from the paper and seized the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Catalan watched him until Caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh
      assault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well!” resumed the Catalan, as he saw the final glimmer of
      Caderousse’s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, I should say, for instance,” resumed Danglars,
      “that if after a voyage such as Dantès has just made, in which he
      touched at the Island of Elba, someone were to denounce him to the king’s
      procureur as a Bonapartist agent”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will denounce him!” exclaimed the young man hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and
      confront you with him you have denounced; I will supply you with the means
      of supporting your accusation, for I know the fact well. But Dantès cannot
      remain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and the
      day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his
      incarceration!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a
      quarrel with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and Mercédès! Mercédès, who will detest you if you have only
      the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True!” said Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” continued Danglars; “if we resolve on such a
      step, it would be much better to take, as I now do, this pen, dip it into
      this ink, and write with the left hand (that the writing may not be
      recognized) the denunciation we propose.” And Danglars, uniting
      practice with theory, wrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed
      from his usual style, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he
      handed to Fernand, and which Fernand read in an undertone:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “The honorable, the king’s attorney, is informed by a friend
      of the throne and religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship <i>Pharaon</i>,
      arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and
      Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for the usurper,
      and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist committee in Paris.
      Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him, for the letter will be
      found upon him, or at his father’s, or in his cabin on board the <i>Pharaon</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good,” resumed Danglars; “now your revenge looks
      like common sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter
      will thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter
      as I am doing, and write upon it, ‘To the king’s attorney,’
      and that’s all settled.” And Danglars wrote the address as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and that’s all settled!” exclaimed Caderousse,
      who, by a last effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the
      letter, and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a
      denunciation must entail. “Yes, and that’s all settled; only
      it will be an infamous shame;” and he stretched out his hand to
      reach the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; “and
      as what I say and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and
      foremost, should be sorry if anything happened to Dantès—the worthy
      Dantès—look here!” And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in
      his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right!” said Caderousse. “Dantès is my friend, and
      I won’t have him ill-used.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who thinks of using him ill? Certainly neither I nor Fernand,”
      said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained
      seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung
      into the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In this case,” replied Caderousse, “let’s have
      some more wine. I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely
      Mercédès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have had too much already, drunkard,” said Danglars;
      “and if you continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because
      unable to stand on your legs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?” said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of
      a drunken man, “I can’t keep on my legs? Why, I’ll wager
      I can go up into the belfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Done!” said Danglars, “I’ll take your bet; but
      tomorrow—today it is time to return. Give me your arm, and let us
      go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, let us go,” said Caderousse; “but I don’t
      want your arm at all. Come, Fernand, won’t you return to Marseilles
      with us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Fernand; “I shall return to the Catalans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re wrong. Come with us to Marseilles—come along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince;
      there’s liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the
      young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars took advantage of Caderousse’s temper at the moment, to
      take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as
      he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw
      Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his pocket
      then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Caderousse, “why, what a lie he told! He
      said he was going to the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo,
      Fernand!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you don’t see straight,” said Danglars; “he’s
      gone right enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Caderousse, “I should have said not—how
      treacherous wine is!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come,” said Danglars to himself, “now the thing
      is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he morning’s
      sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves into a network of
      ruby-tinted light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Réserve, with
      whose arbor the reader is already familiar. The apartment destined for the
      purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each of
      which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name
      of one of the principal cities of France; beneath these windows a wooden
      balcony extended the entire length of the house. And although the
      entertainment was fixed for twelve o’clock, an hour previous to that
      time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests,
      consisting of the favored part of the crew of the <i>Pharaon</i>, and
      other personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed
      themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the <i>Pharaon</i>
      had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in
      doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could
      possibly be intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by Caderousse,
      effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed
      with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La
      Réserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an
      enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the <i>Pharaon</i>, who
      hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose
      wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in
      command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board his
      vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding
      that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with
      their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched in
      search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival
      of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively
      sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere
      they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them,
      composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on
      the bride, by whose side walked Dantès’ father; the whole brought up
      by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his
      countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the
      sunshine and the presence of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty shake
      of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside
      Fernand and old Dantès,—the latter of whom attracted universal
      notice. The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk,
      trimmed with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin but
      wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings,
      evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat
      depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came
      along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged
      countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of
      the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the
      Tuileries and Luxembourg. Beside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to
      partake of the good things provided for the wedding-party had induced him
      to become reconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still
      lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of
      the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning
      the dim and misty outline of a dream.

    </h5>
    <p>
      As Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of
      deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who
      seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such
      a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally,
      however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous
      contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless
      gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like one who either
      anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to
      the merchant service—a costume somewhat between a military and a
      civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness,
      a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès boasted the same
      bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved with
      the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more practiced
      in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or,
      at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have
      concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary,
      the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say:
      “If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Réserve, M. Morrel
      descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors
      there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that
      Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere. Edmond, at the
      approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride
      within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of
      wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was
      gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight
      structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father,” said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the
      centre of the table, “sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left
      I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me,” pointing
      with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to
      inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and
      even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen
      retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been
      occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was
      seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from
      Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most
      agreeable.
    </p>

      Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and
      lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and
      brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel
      within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than
      rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster,—all the delicacies, in
      fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and
      styled by the grateful fishermen “fruits of the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A pretty silence truly!” said the old father of the
      bridegroom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and
      brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès
      herself. “Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy,
      merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours
      away?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” sighed Caderousse, “a man cannot always feel happy
      because he is about to be married.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The truth is,” replied Dantès, “that I am too happy for
      noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy
      friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to
      oppress us almost the same as sorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and
      betrayed each fresh impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, what ails you?” asked he of Edmond. “Do you fear
      any approaching evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at
      this instant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that is the very thing that alarms me,” returned Dantès.
      “Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so
      unmixed; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our
      childhood, where fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach;
      and monsters of all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory
      is ours. I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an
      honor of which I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of
      Mercédès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, nay!” cried Caderousse, smiling, “you have not
      attained that honor yet. Mercédès is not yet your wife. Just assume the
      tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your
      hour is not yet come!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at
      every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of
      perspiration that gathered on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to
      contradict me for such a trifle as that. ‘Tis true that Mercédès is
      not actually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in
      an hour and a half she will be.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception
      of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his
      large white teeth. Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand
      grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In an hour?” inquired Danglars, turning pale. “How is
      that, my friend?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, thus it is,” replied Dantès. “Thanks to the
      influence of M. Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I
      enjoy, every difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to
      waive the usual delay; and at half-past two o’clock the mayor of
      Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past
      one has already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in
      saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become
      Madame Dantès.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow, and
      he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling
      from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not refrain from
      uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy
      felicitations of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word,” cried the old man, “you make short work
      of this kind of affair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married
      today at three o’clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick
      way to work!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” asked Danglars, in a timid tone, “how did you
      manage about the other formalities—the contract—the
      settlement?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The contract,” answered Dantès, laughingly, “it didn’t
      take long to fix that. Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on
      her. So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do
      not come very expensive.” This joke elicited a fresh burst of
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out
      to be the actual wedding dinner!” said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” answered Dantès; “don’t imagine I am
      going to put you off in that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for
      Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge
      the commission entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall
      be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real
      marriage feast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to
      such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the
      repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it
      difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s
      tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride
      and bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by
      a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made
      an expressive gesture to Edmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at
      such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social
      position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the
      commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according
      to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more agreeable
      companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a reply and each
      one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand’s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars.
      As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the
      damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as
      though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening
      sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the
      salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most
      anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word,” said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly
      treatment of Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had
      partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès’
      good fortune,—“upon my word, Dantès is a downright good
      fellow, and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so
      soon to be. I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have
      served him that trick you were planning yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, there was no harm meant,” answered Danglars; “at
      first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be
      tempted to do; but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings,
      even so far as to become one of his rival’s attendants, I knew there
      was no further cause for apprehension.” Caderousse looked full at
      Fernand—he was ghastly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly,” continued Danglars, “the sacrifice was no
      trifling one, when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul,
      that future captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad, I only wish he would let
      me take his place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we not set forth?” asked the sweet, silvery voice of
      Mercédès; “two o’clock has just struck, and you know we are
      expected in a quarter of an hour.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      “To be sure!—to be sure!” cried Dantès, eagerly quitting
      the table; “let us go directly!”
    </p>
    <p>
      His words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change
      in Fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an
      almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open
      windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on
      the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking
      of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many
      voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among
      whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every
      disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike
      stillness prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the
      door. The company looked at each other in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I demand admittance,” said a loud voice outside the room,
      “in the name of the law!” As no attempt was made to prevent
      it, the door was opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf,
      presented himself, followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness
      now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present.
    </p>
    <p>
      “May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?”
      said M. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; “there
      is doubtless some mistake easily explained.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every
      reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest,
      and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must,
      nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers
      to the name of Edmond Dantès?” Every eye was turned towards the
      young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with
      dignity, and said, in a firm voice, “I am he; what is your pleasure
      with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you
      in the name of the law!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Me!” repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, “and
      wherefore, I pray?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the
      reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary
      examination.”
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He saw
      before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well
      knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked
      with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble
      effigy. Old Dantès, however, sprang forward. There are situations which
      the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand. He prayed
      and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched,
      and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, “My worthy friend,
      let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has probably
      neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and
      it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given
      the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the
      value of his freight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the meaning of all this?” inquired Caderousse,
      frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      “How can I tell you?” replied he; “I am, like yourself,
      utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make
      out what it is about.” Caderousse then looked around for Fernand,
      but he had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling
      clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared
      effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the
      evening before had raised between himself and his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars,
      “this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting
      yesterday? All I can say is, that if it be so, ‘tis an ill turn, and
      well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense,” returned Danglars, “I tell you again I have
      nothing whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore
      the paper to pieces.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely
      threw it by—I saw it lying in a corner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hold your tongue, you fool!—what should you know about it?—why,
      you were drunk!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every
      prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never
      mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor
      friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake
      of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to
      the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make yourselves
      quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up,
      that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so
      far as the prison to effect that.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="./The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas [père]_files/0075m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0075m "><br>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached
      the group, “nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed
      by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed
      by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards
      Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!” cried Mercédès, stretching out
      her arms to him from the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken heart,
      and leaning from the coach he called out, “Good-bye, Mercédès—we
      shall soon meet again!” Then the vehicle disappeared round one of
      the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait for me here, all of you!” cried M. Morrel; “I will
      take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will
      bring you word how all is going on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go,
      and return as quickly as you can!”
    </p>
    <p>
      This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of
      terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old
      father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief;
      but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and
      with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of
      water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down
      at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to
      the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released
      from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès. Instinctively
      Fernand drew back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,”
      whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to
      Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t think so,” answered the other; “he’s
      too stupid to imagine such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall
      upon the head of whoever wrought it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,”
      said Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surely,” answered Danglars, “one cannot be held
      responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody’s
      head.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning
      towards him, “of this event?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” replied he, “I think it just possible Dantès may
      have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered
      here as contraband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars,
      since you are the ship’s supercargo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the
      merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with
      cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s
      warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to
      know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my
      poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another
      of tobacco for me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars. “Now the mischief
      is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the
      ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès’ hidden treasures.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s
      arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out
      in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come,” said the old man, “be comforted, my poor
      child; there is still hope!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hope!” repeated Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hope!” faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die
      away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good news! good news!” shouted forth one of the party
      stationed in the balcony on the lookout. “Here comes M. Morrel back.
      No doubt, now, we shall hear that our friend is released!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at
      the door. He was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, my friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake
      of his head, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I
      expected.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!” sobbed forth
      Mercédès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is
      charged”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our
      readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became
      in the period at which our story is dated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès; the old man sank into
      a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, Danglars!” whispered Caderousse, “you have deceived
      me—the trick you spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot
      suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your
      fault. I am determined to tell them all about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be silent, you simpleton!” cried Danglars, grasping him by
      the arm, “or I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can
      tell whether Dantès be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba,
      where he quitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any
      letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him,
      will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his
      accomplices?”
    </p>
    <p>
      With the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived the
      solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on
      Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,” said he,
      casting a bewildered look on his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be sure!” answered Danglars. “Let us wait, by all
      means. If he be innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty,
      why, it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With all my heart!” replied Danglars, pleased to find the
      other so tractable. “Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave
      things for the present to take their course.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and
      protector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, while the friends of
      Dantès conducted the now half-fainting man back to his abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumor of Edmond’s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in
      circulating throughout the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?”
      asked M. Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning
      fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he
      overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. “Could you have believed
      such a thing possible?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you know I told you,” replied Danglars, “that I
      considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba
      as a very suspicious circumstance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Certainly not!” returned Danglars. Then added in a low
      whisper, “You understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar
      Morrel, who served under the <i>other</i> government, and who does not
      altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly
      suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared
      to injure both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to
      a soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is
      bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are
      many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis well, Danglars—‘tis well!” replied M.
      Morrel. “You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your
      interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the <i>Pharaon</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible you were so kind?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his
      opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in
      your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what was his reply?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair
      which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that
      whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s
      owner would have his preference also.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The hypocrite!” murmured Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse. “No one can deny his
      being a noble-hearted young fellow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But meanwhile,” continued M. Morrel, “here is the <i>Pharaon</i>
      without a captain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” replied Danglars, “since we cannot leave this port
      for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that
      period Dantès will be set at liberty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No doubt; but in the meantime?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,” answered Danglars.
      “You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most
      experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to
      you to accept my services, that upon Edmond’s release from prison no
      further change will be requisite on board the <i>Pharaon</i> than for
      Dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, Danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties. I
      fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the <i>Pharaon</i>,
      and look carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes
      must never be allowed to interfere with business.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be
      permitted to see our poor Edmond?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom
      I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond’s favor. I am aware he is a
      furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king’s
      attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps not,” replied Danglars; “but I hear that he is
      ambitious, and that’s rather against him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well,” returned M. Morrel, “we shall see. But now
      hasten on board, I will join you there ere long.” So saying, the
      worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded in the direction of
      the Palais de Justice.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “You see,” said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, “the
      turn things have taken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his
      defence?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a
      mere joke should lead to such consequences.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself,
      but Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of
      the room—indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” replied Caderousse, “that I can answer for,
      you did not. I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying
      all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and
      either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not take
      the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he may
      have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting was
      disguised.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you were aware of Dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke,
      nothing more. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon
      the truth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still,” argued Caderousse, “I would give a great deal
      if nothing of the kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand
      in it. You will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for
      both of us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty
      person; and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any
      way? All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain
      perfectly quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see
      that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Amen!” responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of
      adieu to Danglars, and bending his steps towards the Allées de Meillan,
      moving his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of
      one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So far, then,” said Danglars, mentally, “all has gone
      as I would have it. I am, temporarily, commander of the <i>Pharaon</i>,
      with the certainty of being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse
      can be persuaded to hold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of Dantès
      being released. But, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,”
      added he with a smile, “she will take her own.” So saying, he
      leaped into a boat, desiring to be rowed on board the <i>Pharaon</i>,
      where M. Morrel had agreed to meet him.

      Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n one of the
      aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand Cours opposite
      the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being celebrated, almost
      at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by Dantès. In this case,
      however, although the occasion of the entertainment was similar, the
      company was strikingly dissimilar. Instead of a rude mixture of sailors,
      soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present
      assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society,—magistrates
      who had resigned their office during the usurper’s reign; officers
      who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Condé; and
      younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom
      five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of
      restoration elevate to the rank of a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation
      that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then
      agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries
      religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of
      party feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held
      sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a
      small population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been
      accustomed to hear the “<i>Vive Napoléons</i>” of a hundred
      and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was
      looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh
      connection with France or claim to her throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part
      of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the women
      commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the downfall of the
      man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that they rejoiced, and
      in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a
      revivified political existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and proposed
      the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de Saint-Méran. This
      toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the
      peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were
      elevated in the air <i>à l’Anglaise</i>, and the ladies, snatching
      their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral
      treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the Marquise de Saint-Méran, a woman with a stern,
      forbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance,
      despite her fifty years—“ah, these revolutionists, who have
      driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere
      trifle during the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they
      here, that all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to
      follow the fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary,
      made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not
      help admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and
      station was truly our ‘Louis the well-beloved,’ while their
      wretched usurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius,
      their ‘Napoleon the accursed.’ Am I not right, Villefort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in
      truth—I was not attending to the conversation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had
      proposed the toast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on
      one’s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation
      than dry politics.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl,
      with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in
      liquid crystal, “‘tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de
      Villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said. But there—now
      take him—he is your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg
      to remind you my mother speaks to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly
      caught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of
      tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but,
      however all other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature,
      there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and
      that is the shrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was
      saying, Villefort, was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity,
      enthusiasm, or devotion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,”
      replied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the
      Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious
      followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the
      personification of equality.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of
      equality! For mercy’s sake, then, what would you call Robespierre?
      Come, come, do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on
      the Corsican, who, to my mind, has usurped quite enough.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right
      pedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis
      Quinze; that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only
      difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by
      these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the
      equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine,
      the other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,”
      said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both these men
      were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of
      April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being
      gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and
      that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever,
      Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites. Still,
      marquise, it has been so with other usurpers—Cromwell, for instance,
      who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and advocates.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully
      revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the son
      of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A
      deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father
      was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the
      king’s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the
      Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on
      which your father perished.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest
      degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind,
      if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and
      proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I
      may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents
      of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new
      government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count
      Noirtier became a senator.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it
      was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be
      laid aside.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my
      earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will
      kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What
      avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I
      have laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his
      political principles. He was—nay, probably may still be—a
      Bonapartist, and is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch
      royalist, and style myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of
      revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and
      condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a
      distance from the parent tree, without having the power, any more than the
      wish, to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo, Villefort!” cried the marquis; “excellently well
      said! Come, now, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years
      endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty
      and forgetfulness of the past.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past
      be forever forgotten. I promise you it affords <i>me</i> as little
      pleasure to revive it as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be
      firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember,
      also, Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your
      fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king
      consented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him
      her hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind,
      that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the
      government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with
      rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as
      well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have
      already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought
      the offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing
      yet.”

    <p>
      “Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is
      too near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.
      Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one
      frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from
      hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons,
      and assassinations in the lower.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of
      M. de Saint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,
      “that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M.
      de Saint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Saint Helena.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two
      thousand leagues from here,” replied the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of
      folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and
      Naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy,
      the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties
      of 1814, and we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded M. de
      Salvieux. “There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was
      a question of shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by
      the aid of the Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must
      trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his
      partisans. The king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as
      sovereign of France, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and
      this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put
      down every attempt at conspiracy—‘tis the best and surest
      means of preventing mischief.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately, madame,” answered Villefort, “the strong
      arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken
      place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it
      can do is to avenge the wrong done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, M. de Villefort,” cried a beautiful young creature,
      daughter to the Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of
      Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, “do try and get up some famous trial
      while we are at Marseilles. I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so
      very amusing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Amusing, certainly,” replied the young man, “inasmuch
      as, instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at
      a theatre, you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress—a
      drama of life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and
      alarmed, instead of—as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy—going
      home to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he
      may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,—is removed from your
      sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the
      executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to
      bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that should
      any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you the
      choice of being present.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For shame, M. de Villefort!” said Renée, becoming quite pale;
      “don’t you see how you are frightening us?—and yet you
      laugh.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would you have? ‘Tis like a duel. I have already
      recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of
      political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready
      sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my
      heart?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,” said Renée, becoming more
      and more terrified; “you surely are not in earnest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed I am,” replied the young magistrate with a smile;
      “and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness,
      the case would only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the
      prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon—well,
      can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his
      commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will
      scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his
      personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because
      bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one requires the
      excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash
      one’s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power. I would
      not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in
      mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated,
      and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence.”
      Renée uttered a smothered exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo!” cried one of the guests; “that is what I call
      talking to some purpose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just the person we require at a time like the present,” said
      a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear
      Villefort!” remarked a third; “I mean the trial of the man for
      murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had
      laid his hand upon him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,”
      interposed Renée, “it matters very little what is done to them; but
      as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having
      mixed themselves up in political intrigues”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit;
      for, don’t you see, Renée, the king is the father of his people, and
      he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the
      parent of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully
      great scale?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know anything about that,” replied Renée;
      “but, M. de Villefort, you have promised me—have you not?—always
      to show mercy to those I plead for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Make yourself quite easy on that point,” answered Villefort,
      with one of his sweetest smiles; “you and I will always consult upon
      our verdicts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My love,” said the marquise, “attend to your doves,
      your lap-dogs, and embroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not
      understand. Nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the
      magisterial robe is the badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that
      is very much in point.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Cedant arma togæ</i>,” said Villefort with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot speak Latin,” responded the marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Renée, “I cannot help regretting you had
      not chosen some other profession than your own—a physician, for
      instance. Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a <i>destroying</i>
      angel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear, good Renée,” whispered Villefort, as he gazed with
      unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us hope, my child,” cried the marquis, “that M. de
      Villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province; if
      so, he will have achieved a noble work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father’s
      conduct,” added the incorrigible marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, “I
      have already had the honor to observe that my father has—at least, I
      hope so—abjured his past errors, and that he is, at the present
      moment, a firm and zealous friend to religion and order—a better
      royalist, possibly, than his son; for he has to atone for past
      dereliction, while I have no other impulse than warm, decided preference
      and conviction.” Having made this well-turned speech, Villefort
      looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory, much as he
      would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know, my dear Villefort,” cried the Comte de Salvieux,
      “that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries,
      when questioned by his majesty’s principal chamberlain touching the
      singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter
      of an officer of the Duc de Condé; and I assure you he seemed fully to
      comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based
      upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who, without our
      suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted us by saying,
      ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the
      word Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on that
      of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a
      young man of great judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a
      figure in his profession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure
      to hear that he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and
      Marquise de Saint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had
      not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to
      it.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to
      express himself so favorably of me?” asked the enraptured Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid,
      he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to
      him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your
      espousing his daughter.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “That is true,” answered the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not
      do to evince my earnest gratitude!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is right,” cried the marquise. “I love to see you
      thus. Now, then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be
      most welcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust
      your wishes will not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty
      offenders, poor debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s
      hands,—then I shall be contented.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be
      called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of wasps,
      or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to see me the
      king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent and
      dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the
      physician.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had
      sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and
      whispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table
      and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however,
      returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded him with
      fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then
      were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the
      innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her,
      “that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble
      the disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in
      1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my
      betrothal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And wherefore were you called away just now?” asked
      Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the
      executioner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How dreadful!” exclaimed Renée, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near
      enough to the magistrate to hear his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist
      conspiracy has just been discovered.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can I believe my ears?” cried the marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,”
      said Villefort:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the
      throne and the religions institutions of his country, that one named
      Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship <i>Pharaon</i>, this day arrived from
      Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the
      bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of
      another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample
      corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the
      above-mentioned Edmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris
      about with him, or has it at his father’s abode. Should it not be
      found in the possession of father or son, then it will assuredly be
      discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the <i>Pharaon</i>.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Renée, “this letter, which, after all, is
      but an anonymous scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king’s
      attorney.”

      “True; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his
      orders, opened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for
      me, but not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for
      arresting the accused party.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?” said the
      marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, dear mother, say the accused person. You know we cannot yet
      pronounce him guilty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is in safe custody,” answered Villefort; “and rely
      upon it, if the letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted
      abroad again, unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the
      headsman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where is the unfortunate being?” asked Renée.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is at my house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come, my friend,” interrupted the marquise, “do
      not neglect your duty to linger with us. You are the king’s servant,
      and must go wherever that service calls you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O Villefort!” cried Renée, clasping her hands, and looking
      towards her lover with piteous earnestness, “be merciful on this the
      day of our betrothal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader
      sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “To give you pleasure, my sweet Renée, I promise to show all the
      lenity in my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist
      hero prove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his
      head to be cut off.” Renée shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind that foolish girl, Villefort,” said the marquise.
      “She will soon get over these things.” So saying, Madame de
      Saint-Méran extended her dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting
      a son-in-law’s respectful salute on it, looked at Renée, as much as
      to say, “I must try and fancy ‘tis your dear hand I kiss, as
      it should have been.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,” sighed
      poor Renée.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word, child!” exclaimed the angry marquise, “your
      folly exceeds all bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there
      can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the
      state!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O mother!” murmured Renée.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor. I promise you
      that to make up for her want of loyalty, I will be most inflexibly severe;”
      then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to say,
      “Fear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with
      mercy,” and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return,
      Villefort quitted the room.

      Chapter 7. The Examination
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o sooner had
      Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds
      the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in spite of the nobility
      of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had
      carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to
      assume an air of judicial severity. Except the recollection of the line of
      politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he
      acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, Gérard de Villefort
      was as happy as a man could be. Already rich, he held a high official
      situation, though only twenty-seven. He was about to marry a young and
      charming woman, whom he loved, not passionately, but reasonably, as became
      a deputy attorney of the king; and besides her personal attractions, which
      were very great, Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s family possessed
      considerable political influence, which they would, of course, exert in
      his favor. The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he
      had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a
      million at her father’s death. These considerations naturally gave
      Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly
      dazzled in its contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him. The
      sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth;
      he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “I have
      read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man;
      now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers
      found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself is
      named Edmond Dantès, mate on board the three-master the <i>Pharaon</i>,
      trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel
      &amp; Son, of Marseilles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the
      marines?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How old?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nineteen or twenty at the most.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des
      Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him, approached; it
      was M. Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, M. de Villefort,” cried he, “I am delighted to see
      you. Some of your people have committed the strangest mistake—they
      have just arrested Edmond Dantès, mate of my vessel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it, monsieur,” replied Villefort, “and I am now
      going to examine him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, “you
      do not know him, and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy
      creature in the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better
      seaman in all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your
      indulgence for him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at
      Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other
      suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and
      replied,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and
      trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service,
      and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply them
      to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of
      one who, interceding for another, had himself need of indulgence. Morrel
      reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics; besides,
      what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal, and what
      the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He replied, however,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and
      equitable, and give him back to us soon.” This <i>give us</i>
      sounded revolutionary in the deputy’s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, ah,” murmured he, “is Dantès then a member of some
      Carbonari society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He
      was, if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many
      others.” Then he added, “Monsieur, you may rest assured I
      shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall
      not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this
      present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do
      my duty.”

      As he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the
      Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the shipowner,
      who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had left him. The
      antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in the midst of whom,
      carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the prisoner. Villefort
      traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at Dantès, and taking a
      packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, “Bring in
      the prisoner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapid as had been Villefort’s glance, it had served to give him an
      idea of the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized
      intelligence in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow,
      and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.
      Villefort’s first impression was favorable; but he had been so often
      warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the
      impression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He stifled,
      therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his
      features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant after
      Dantès entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his
      judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been in
      M. Morrel’s salon. It was then that he encountered for the first
      time Villefort’s look,—that look peculiar to the magistrate,
      who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who and what are you?” demanded Villefort, turning over a
      pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a
      police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour’s
      time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt
      espionage of which “the accused” is always made the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name is Edmond Dantès,” replied the young man calmly;
      “I am mate of the <i>Pharaon</i>, belonging to Messrs. Morrel &amp;
      Son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your age?” continued Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nineteen,” returned Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the
      young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between
      that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great
      was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the
      radiant face of Mercédès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were at the festival of your marriage?” said the deputy,
      shuddering in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have
      been attached to for three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was,
      was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès,
      surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his
      own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was
      summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. “This
      philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great
      sensation at M. de Saint-Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally,
      while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators
      often create a reputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged,
      Villefort turned to Dantès.

    <p>
      “Go on, sir,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would you have me say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Give all the information in your power.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all
      I know; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very
      little.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you served under the usurper?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said
      Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to
      make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I
      never had any opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no
      part to play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M.
      Morrel. Thus all my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are
      confined to these three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M.
      Morrel, and I adore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you
      see how uninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at
      his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée,
      who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for
      him. With the deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word
      the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This
      lad, for he was scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that
      eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for
      everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the
      wicked good—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of
      Villefort’s severe look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>“Pardieu!”</i> said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow.
      I hope I shall gain Renée’s favor easily by obeying the first
      command she ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of the
      hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.” Full of this idea,
      Villefort’s face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dantès,
      the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least,
      that you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my position is not
      sufficiently elevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps,
      somewhat too hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or
      twelve sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that
      they love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an
      elder brother.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain
      at nineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl,
      who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the
      envy of someone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may
      possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my
      acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced to
      hate them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you.
      You seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty
      to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the
      paper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the
      letter from his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A
      cloud passed over his brow as he said,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably
      plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,” added he,
      looking gratefully at Villefort, “to be examined by such a man as
      you; for this envious person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid
      glance that the young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much
      energy lay hid beneath this mildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a
      prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in
      him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous
      letter?” And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter
      Dantès had just given back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as
      a sailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak, monsieur,” said Villefort. Then, internally, “If
      Renée could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer
      call me a decapitator.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a
      brain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive
      at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to
      such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying, he
      called me to him. ‘My dear Dantès,’ said he, ‘swear to
      perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest
      importance.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I swear, captain,’ replied I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate,
      assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at
      Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter—perhaps
      they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You
      will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and
      profit from it.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted
      to the grand-marshal’s presence as easily as you expect?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove
      every difficulty,’ said the captain. At these words he gave me a
      ring. It was time—two hours after he was delirious; the next day he
      died.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did you do then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my
      place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with a
      sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for the
      Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to
      remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found some
      difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I
      had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted. He
      questioned me concerning Captain Leclere’s death; and, as the latter
      had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I
      undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed here,
      regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my affianced
      bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the
      forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast;
      and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to
      start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well
      as I now see to be unjust.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Villefort, “this seems to me the truth. If
      you have been culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in
      obedience to the orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have
      brought from Elba, and pass your word you will appear should you be
      required, and go and rejoin your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am free, then, sir?” cried Dantès joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but first give me this letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others
      which I see in that packet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop a moment,” said the deputy, as Dantès took his hat and
      gloves. “To whom is it addressed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>“To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris.”</i> Had a
      thunderbolt fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more
      stupefied. He sank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet,
      drew forth the fatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13,” murmured he, growing
      still paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Dantès; “do you know him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Villefort; “a faithful servant of the king
      does not know conspirators.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “It is a conspiracy, then?” asked Dantès, who after believing
      himself free, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. “I have, however,
      already told you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the
      letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,”
      said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you shown this letter to anyone?” asked Villefort,
      becoming still more pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To no one, on my honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the
      Island of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that was too much, far too much,” murmured Villefort.
      Villefort’s brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched
      teeth filled Dantès with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort
      covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Dantès timidly, “what is the matter?”
      Villefort made no answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few
      seconds, and again perused the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I give you my word of honor, sir,” said Dantès; “but
      what is the matter? You are ill—shall I ring for assistance?—shall
      I call?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Villefort, rising hastily; “stay where you
      are. It is for me to give orders here, and not you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” replied Dantès proudly, “it was only to
      summon assistance for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;
      answer me.” Dantès waited, expecting a question, but in vain.
      Villefort fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist
      with perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, if he knows the contents of this!” murmured he, “and
      that Noirtier is the father of Villefort, I am lost!” And he fixed
      his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,” cried he, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In heaven’s name!” cried the unhappy young man, “if
      you doubt me, question me; I will answer you.” Villefort made a
      violent effort, and in a tone he strove to render firm,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said he, “I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to
      restore you immediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the
      trial justice; what my own feeling is you already know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, monsieur,” cried Dantès, “you have been rather a
      friend than a judge.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make
      it as short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,
      and you see——” Villefort approached the fire, cast it
      in, and waited until it was entirely consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see, I destroy it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” exclaimed Dantès, “you are goodness itself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen,” continued Villefort; “you can now have
      confidence in me after what I have done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, command, and I will obey.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak, and I will follow your advice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice.
      Should anyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me,
      but do not breathe a word of this letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I promise.” It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the
      prisoner who reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see,” continued he, glancing toward the grate, where
      fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames, “the letter is
      destroyed; you and I alone know of its existence; should you, therefore,
      be questioned, deny all knowledge of it—deny it boldly, and you are
      saved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be satisfied; I will deny it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was the only letter you had?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Swear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I swear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words in
      his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Follow him,” said Villefort to Dantès. Dantès saluted
      Villefort and retired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw
      himself half-fainting into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, alas,” murmured he, “if the procureur himself had
      been at Marseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would
      have destroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always
      interfere with my successes?” Suddenly a light passed over his face,
      a smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This will do,” said he, “and from this letter, which
      might have ruined me, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in
      hand.” And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone,
      the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed.

    <h2>
      Chapter 8. The Château d’If
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he commissary of
      police, as he traversed the antechamber, made a sign to two gendarmes, who
      placed themselves one on Dantès’ right and the other on his left. A
      door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened, and they
      went through a long range of gloomy corridors, whose appearance might have
      made even the boldest shudder. The Palais de Justice communicated with the
      prison,—a sombre edifice, that from its grated windows looks on the
      clock-tower of the Accoules. After numberless windings, Dantès saw a door
      with an iron wicket. The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked
      thrice, every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door
      opened, the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed
      with a loud sound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but
      thick and mephitic,—he was in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred, and
      its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the words
      of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded still in
      his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when Dantès
      was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of March, and
      the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity augmented the
      acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to
      the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died
      away, and Dantès sank again into his seat. At last, about ten o’clock,
      and just as Dantès began to despair, steps were heard in the corridor, a
      key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the massy oaken door flew open,
      and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the torchlight Dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four
      gendarmes. He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this
      display of force.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you come to fetch me?” asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied a gendarme.
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the orders of the deputy procureur?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe so.” The conviction that they came from M. de
      Villefort relieved all Dantès’ apprehensions; he advanced calmly,
      and placed himself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the
      door, the coachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is this carriage for me?” said Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is for you,” replied a gendarme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and having
      neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the steps, and
      was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others took
      their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner glanced at the windows—they were grated; he had changed
      his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither. Through
      the grating, however, Dantès saw they were passing through the Rue
      Caisserie, and by the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis, to the quay.
      Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse, a
      dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; Dantès saw the
      reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can all this force be summoned on my account?” thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer opened the door, which was locked, and, without speaking a
      word, answered Dantès’ question; for he saw between the ranks of the
      soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port. The two gendarmes
      who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered to alight
      and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example. They advanced
      towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a chain, near the
      quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity. In an
      instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the
      gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent
      the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the
      Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of the
      port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantès knew, in the Frioul
      and outside the inner harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner’s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure
      air—for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La
      Réserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the open
      windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dantès folded his hands,
      raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      The boat continued her voyage. They had passed the Tête de Morte, were now
      off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This manœuvre
      was incomprehensible to Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whither are you taking me?” asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will soon know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But still——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are forbidden to give you any explanation.” Dantès,
      trained in discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to
      question subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they
      were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor
      outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on
      some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to
      handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy, who
      had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce the
      dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not Villefort
      in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the right,
      and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner
      that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it was there
      Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercédès that
      her lover was within three hundred yards of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      One light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’
      chamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A loud
      cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not utter
      it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but
      the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. An intervening elevation of land
      hid the light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea.
      While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their oars and
      hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dantès turned to the
      nearest gendarme, and taking his hand,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Comrade,” said he, “I adjure you, as a Christian and a
      soldier, to tell me where we are going. I am Captain Dantès, a loyal
      Frenchman, thought accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting
      me, and I promise you on my honor I will submit to my fate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for answer
      a sign that said, “I see no great harm in telling him now,”
      and the gendarme replied,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not
      know where you are going?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On my honor, I have no idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you no idea whatever?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But my orders.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten
      minutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if I
      intended.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you
      must know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look round you then.” Dantès rose and looked forward, when he
      saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on
      which stands the Château d’If. This gloomy fortress, which has for
      more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends,
      seemed to Dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Château d’If?” cried he, “what are we going
      there for?” The gendarme smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not going there to be imprisoned,” said Dantès; “it
      is only used for political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there
      any magistrates or judges at the Château d’If?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are only,” said the gendarme, “a governor, a
      garrison, turnkeys, and good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so
      astonished, or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for
      my good nature.” Dantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though
      he would crush it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken to the
      Château d’If to be imprisoned there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without any inquiry, without any formality?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already
      made.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so, in spite of M. de Villefort’s promises?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,” said the
      gendarme, “but I know we are taking you to the Château d’If.
      But what are you doing? Help, comrades, help!”
    </p>
    <p>
      By a rapid movement, which the gendarme’s practiced eye had
      perceived, Dantès sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but
      four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat.
      He fell back cursing with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good!” said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest;
      “believe soft-spoken gentlemen again! Hark ye, my friend, I have
      disobeyed my first order, but I will not disobey the second; and if you
      move, I will blow your brains out.” And he levelled his carbine at
      Dantès, who felt the muzzle against his temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending the
      unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he bethought him of M. de
      Villefort’s promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of
      a gendarme seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but gnashing his
      teeth and wringing his hands with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock. One of the
      sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley, and
      Dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they were
      mooring the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      His guards, taking him by the arms and coat-collar, forced him to rise,
      and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress,
      while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream: he saw soldiers
      drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight
      of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a door, and that the
      door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as through a mist. He
      did not even see the ocean, that terrible barrier against freedom, which
      the prisoners look upon with utter despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his thoughts.
      He looked around; he was in a court surrounded by high walls; he heard the
      measured tread of sentinels, and as they passed before the light he saw
      the barrels of their muskets shine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited upwards of ten minutes. Certain Dantès could not escape, the
      gendarmes released him. They seemed awaiting orders. The orders came.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is the prisoner?” said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here,” replied the gendarmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let him follow me; I will take him to his cell.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go!” said the gendarmes, thrusting Dantès forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under
      ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with
      tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and
      showed Dantès the features of his conductor, an under-jailer, ill-clothed,
      and of sullen appearance.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Here is your chamber for tonight,” said he. “It is
      late, and the governor is asleep. Tomorrow, perhaps, he may change you. In
      the meantime there is bread, water, and fresh straw; and that is all a
      prisoner can wish for. Goodnight.” And before Dantès could open his
      mouth—before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the
      water—before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was,
      the jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door,
      leaving stamped upon the prisoner’s mind the dim reflection of the
      dripping walls of his dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès was alone in darkness and in silence—cold as the shadows that
      he felt breathe on his burning forehead. With the first dawn of day the
      jailer returned, with orders to leave Dantès where he was. He found the
      prisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with
      weeping. He had passed the night standing, and without sleep. The jailer
      advanced; Dantès appeared not to perceive him. He touched him on the
      shoulder. Edmond started.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you not slept?” said the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know,” replied Dantès. The jailer stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you hungry?” continued he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you wish for anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish to see the governor.” The jailer shrugged his
      shoulders and left the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès followed him with his eyes, and stretched forth his hands towards
      the open door; but the door closed. All his emotion then burst forth; he
      cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking himself what
      crime he had committed that he was thus punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and round
      the cell like a wild beast in its cage. One thought in particular
      tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so still,
      whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and, thanks to
      his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained the shore,
      concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish vessel,
      escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercédès and his father could have joined
      him. He had no fears as to how he should live—good seamen are
      welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish like a
      Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Mercédès and his
      father, whereas he was now confined in the Château d’If, that
      impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and
      Mercédès; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort’s
      promise. The thought was maddening, and Dantès threw himself furiously
      down on his straw. The next morning at the same hour, the jailer came
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said the jailer, “are you more reasonable today?”
      Dantès made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish to see the governor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have already told you it was impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask
      for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is allowed, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care
      to walk about; but I wish to see the governor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you
      any more to eat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” said Edmond, “if you do not, I shall die
      of hunger—that is all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every prisoner
      is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more subdued tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you
      will be allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor,
      and if he chooses to reply, that is his affair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” asked Dantès, “how long shall I have to wait?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, a month—six months—a year.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is too long a time. I wish to see him at once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the jailer, “do not always brood over what is
      impossible, or you will be mad in a fortnight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; we have an instance here; it was by always offering a million
      of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad, who was
      in this chamber before you.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “How long has he left it?”

    <p>
      “Two years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was he liberated, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; he was put in a dungeon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen!” said Dantès. “I am not an abbé, I am not mad;
      perhaps I shall be, but at present, unfortunately, I am not. I will make
      you another offer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not offer you a million, because I have it not; but I will
      give you a hundred crowns if, the first time you go to Marseilles, you
      will seek out a young girl named Mercédès, at the Catalans, and give her
      two lines from me.”

      “If I took them, and were detected, I should lose my place, which is
      worth two thousand francs a year; so that I should be a great fool to run
      such a risk for three hundred.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Dantès, “mark this; if you refuse at least
      to tell Mercédès I am here, I will some day hide myself behind the door,
      and when you enter I will dash out your brains with this stool.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Threats!” cried the jailer, retreating and putting himself on
      the defensive; “you are certainly going mad. The abbé began like
      you, and in three days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but,
      fortunately, there are dungeons here.” Dantès whirled the stool
      round his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right, all right,” said the jailer; “all right,
      since you will have it so. I will send word to the governor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well,” returned Dantès, dropping the stool and sitting
      on it as if he were in reality mad. The jailer went out, and returned in
      an instant with a corporal and four soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the governor’s orders,” said he, “conduct the
      prisoner to the tier beneath.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the dungeon, then,” said the corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; we must put the madman with the madmen.” The soldiers
      seized Dantès, who followed passively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and he
      was thrust in. The door closed, and Dantès advanced with outstretched
      hands until he touched the wall; he then sat down in the corner until his
      eyes became accustomed to the darkness. The jailer was right; Dantès
      wanted but little of being utterly mad.

      Chapter 9. The Evening of the Betrothal
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">V</span>illefort had, as
      we have said, hastened back to Madame de Saint-Méran’s in the Place
      du Grand Cours, and on entering the house found that the guests whom he
      had left at table were taking coffee in the salon. Renée was, with all the
      rest of the company, anxiously awaiting him, and his entrance was followed
      by a general exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is
      the matter?” said one. “Speak out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?” asked
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has the Corsican ogre broken loose?” cried a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Marquise,” said Villefort, approaching his future
      mother-in-law, “I request your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the
      marquis honor me by a few moments’ private conversation?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?” asked the marquis,
      remarking the cloud on Villefort’s brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,”
      added he, turning to Renée, “judge for yourself if it be not
      important.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are going to leave us?” cried Renée, unable to hide her
      emotion at this unexpected announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” returned Villefort, “I must!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where, then, are you going?” asked the marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any
      commissions for Paris, a friend of mine is going there tonight, and will
      with pleasure undertake them.” The guests looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You wish to speak to me alone?” said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, let us go to the library, please.” The marquis took his
      arm, and they left the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, “tell
      me what it is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate
      presence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you any
      landed property?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand
      francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then sell out—sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “But how can I sell out here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have a broker, have you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an
      instant’s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deuce you say!” replied the marquis, “let us lose
      no time, then!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell
      out at the market price.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, then,” said Villefort, placing the letter in his
      pocketbook, “I must have another!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the king.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the king?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I dare not write to his majesty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to
      do so. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king’s
      presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would
      occasion a loss of precious time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right
      of entry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the
      day or night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my
      discovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and take
      all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made if I
      only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget the
      service I do him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him
      write the letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an
      hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell your coachman to stop at the door.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Renée,
      whom I leave on such a day with great regret.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in
      person.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand thanks—and now for the letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis rang, a servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, then, go,” said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall be gone only a few moments.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight of
      the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw
      the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At his door
      he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him. It was
      Mercédès, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come unobserved to
      inquire after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dantès had
      spoken of Mercédès, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty and
      high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of her
      lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The young man you speak of,” said Villefort abruptly, “is
      a great criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.”
      Mercédès burst into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again
      addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is
      alive or dead,” said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,” replied
      Villefort.
    </p>

    <p>
      And desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and
      closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not
      thus banished; like Virgil’s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in
      his wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was
      almost a sob, and sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The man
      he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on the altar
      of his father’s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening,
      leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse,
      not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow and
      consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the
      very moment of death. Then he had a moment’s hesitation. He had
      frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his
      irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest
      shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort’s brow, because they
      were guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose
      happiness he had destroyed: in this case he was not the judge, but the
      executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which
      had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him with
      vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively
      at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed, but
      Villefort’s was one of those that never close, or if they do, only
      close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the sweet
      voice of Renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the fair
      Mercédès had entered and said, “In the name of God, I conjure you to
      restore me my affianced husband,” his cold and trembling hands would
      have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber,
      and the door was opened only by Villefort’s valet, who came to tell
      him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one of
      the drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into his
      pocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head,
      muttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his servant
      had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the carriage,
      ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-Méran’s. The hapless
      Dantès was doomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Renée in
      waiting. He started when he saw Renée, for he fancied she was again about
      to plead for Dantès. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she was
      thinking only of Villefort’s departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to become
      her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and Renée, far from
      pleading for Dantès, hated the man whose crime separated her from her
      lover.

      Meanwhile what of Mercédès? She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue
      de la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly cast
      herself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her hand, and
      covered it with kisses that Mercédès did not even feel. She passed the
      night thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to the
      darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had made
      her blind to all but one object—that was Edmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you are there,” said she, at length, turning towards
      Fernand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have not quitted you since yesterday,” returned Fernand
      sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that Dantès
      had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the
      influential persons of the city; but the report was already in circulation
      that Dantès was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the most sanguine
      looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible,
      he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in despair,
      declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like
      M. Morrel, to aid Dantès, he had shut himself up with two bottles of black
      currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not
      succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not
      so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows on the
      table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the
      light of the unsnuffed candle—spectres such as Hoffmann strews over
      his punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars alone was content and joyous—he had got rid of an enemy and
      made his own situation on the <i>Pharaon</i> secure. Danglars was one of
      those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a
      heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life of
      a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by
      taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires. He
      went to bed at his usual hour, and slept in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort, after having received M. de Salvieux’s letter, embraced
      Renée, kissed the marquise’s hand, and shaken that of the marquis,
      started for Paris along the Aix road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond. But
      we know very well what had become of Edmond.

    <h2>
      Chapter 10. The King’s Closet at the Tuileries
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e will leave
      Villefort on the road to Paris, travelling—thanks to trebled fees—with
      all speed, and passing through two or three apartments, enter at the
      Tuileries the little room with the arched window, so well known as having
      been the favorite closet of Napoleon and Louis XVIII., and now of Louis
      Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from Hartwell,
      and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people, he
      was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was carelessly
      listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with gray hair,
      aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire, and meanwhile
      making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius’s rather inaccurate,
      but much sought-after, edition of Horace—a work which was much
      indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You say, sir”—said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven
      lean kine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty
      and seven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your
      majesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the
      south.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my dear duke,” replied Louis XVIII., “I think you
      are wrongly informed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is
      very fine weather in that direction.” Man of ability as he was,
      Louis XVIII. liked a pleasant jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” continued M. de Blacas, “if it only be to
      reassure a faithful servant, will your majesty send into Languedoc,
      Provence, and Dauphiné, trusty men, who will bring you back a faithful
      report as to the feeling in these three provinces?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Caninus surdis</i>,” replied the king, continuing the
      annotations in his Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might
      seem to comprehend the quotation, “your majesty may be perfectly
      right in relying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not
      altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Blacas,” said the king, “you with your alarms
      prevent me from working.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note
      on the <i>Pastor quum traheret</i>—wait, and I will listen to you
      afterwards.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as
      small as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then
      looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his
      own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, my dear duke, go on—I listen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of
      sacrificing Villefort to his own profit, “I am compelled to tell you
      that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet
      me; but a serious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by
      me to watch over the south” (the duke hesitated as he pronounced
      these words), “has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril
      threatens the king, and so I hastened to you, sire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Mala ducis avi domum</i>,” continued Louis XVIII., still
      annotating.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whichever you please—there to the left.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, sire?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on
      my left—yes, there. You will find yesterday’s report of the
      minister of police. But here is M. Dandré himself;” and M. Dandré,
      announced by the chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in,” said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, “come
      in, Baron, and tell the duke all you know—the latest news of M. de
      Bonaparte; do not conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the
      Island of Elba is a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence
      flaming and bristling war—<i>bella, horrida bella</i>.” M.
      Dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands,
      and said,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what
      the report contains—give him the particulars of what the usurper is
      doing in his islet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” said the baron to the duke, “all the
      servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we
      have from the Island of Elba. Bonaparte——”
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Dandré looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did not
      even raise his head. “Bonaparte,” continued the baron, “is
      mortally wearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at
      Porto-Longone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And scratches himself for amusement,” added the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Scratches himself?” inquired the duke, “what does your
      majesty mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this
      hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries
      him to death, <i>prurigo</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And, moreover, my dear duke,” continued the minister of
      police, “we are almost assured that, in a very short time, the
      usurper will be insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Insane?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly,
      sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the
      seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes ‘duck-and-drake’
      five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had gained another
      Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are indubitable
      symptoms of insanity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or of wisdom, my dear baron—or of wisdom,” said Louis
      XVIII., laughing; “the greatest captains of antiquity amused
      themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean—see Plutarch’s
      life of Scipio Africanus.”
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the
      truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole
      secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had
      yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well, Dandré,” said Louis XVIII., “Blacas is not
      yet convinced; let us proceed, therefore, to the usurper’s
      conversion.” The minister of police bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The usurper’s conversion!” murmured the duke, looking
      at the king and Dandré, who spoke alternately, like Virgil’s
      shepherds. “The usurper converted!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Decidedly, my dear duke.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what way converted?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, this is the way of it,” said the minister, with the
      gravest air in the world: “Napoleon lately had a review, and as two
      or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he
      gave them their dismissal, and exhorted them to ‘serve the good
      king.’ These were his own words, of that I am certain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Blacas, what think you of this?” inquired the king
      triumphantly, and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I
      am; and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the
      guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable that
      I am in error. However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will
      interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your
      majesty to do him this honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person
      you please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding. Baron, have
      you any report more recent than this dated the 20th February.—this
      is the 3rd of March?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since
      I left my office.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go thither, and if there be none—well, well,” continued
      Louis XVIII., “make one; that is the usual way, is it not?”
      and the king laughed facetiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sire,” replied the minister, “we have no occasion
      to invent any; every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial
      denunciations, coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for
      services which they seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and
      rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, go”; said Louis XVIII., “and remember that I
      am waiting for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will but go and return, sire; I shall be back in ten minutes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I, sire,” said M. de Blacas, “will go and find my
      messenger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait, sir, wait,” said Louis XVIII. “Really, M. de
      Blacas, I must change your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle
      with outstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain
      to escape, and bearing this device—<i>Tenax</i>.”

    <p>
      “Sire, I listen,” said De Blacas, biting his nails with
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish to consult you on this passage, ‘<i>Molli fugiens
      anhelitu</i>,’ you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. Are
      you not a sportsman and a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think
      of the <i>molli anhelitu</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to,
      for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when
      we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and
      that without getting in the least out of breath.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has
      come so far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful
      information. If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to
      me, I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Salvieux, my brother’s chamberlain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is at Marseilles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And writes me thence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present
      him to your majesty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Villefort!” cried the king, “is the messenger’s
      name M. de Villefort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And he comes from Marseilles?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In person.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why did you not mention his name at once?” replied the king,
      betraying some uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,
      ambitious, too, and, <i>pardieu!</i>, you know his father’s name!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Noirtier.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Noirtier the Girondin?—Noirtier the senator?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you
      Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would
      sacrifice everything, even his father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, sire, may I present him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This instant, duke! Where is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Waiting below, in my carriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Seek him at once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hasten to do so.” The duke left the royal presence with the
      speed of a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again.
      Louis XVIII. remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened
      Horace, muttered,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Justum et tenacem propositi virum</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the
      antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king’s authority.
      Villefort’s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut,
      excited the susceptibility of M. de Brezé, who was all astonishment at
      finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in
      such attire. The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word—his
      majesty’s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master
      of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles, Villefort
      was introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On
      opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young
      magistrate’s first impulse was to pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in, M. de Villefort,” said the king, “come in.”
      Villefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should
      interrogate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., “the Duc de Blacas
      assures me you have some interesting information to communicate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it
      equally important.”

    <p>
      “In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as
      bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I
      have used, that it is not irreparable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak as fully as you please, sir,” said the king, who began
      to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas’s face
      and affected Villefort’s voice. “Speak, sir, and pray begin at
      the beginning; I like order in everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” said Villefort, “I will render a faithful report
      to your majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads
      to some obscurity in my language.” A glance at the king after this
      discreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his
      august auditor, and he went on:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your
      majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a
      commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the
      lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy—a
      storm which menaces no less than your majesty’s throne. Sire, the
      usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however
      mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba, to
      go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at
      Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France.
      Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has
      maintained his relations with Italy and France?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am, sir,” said the king, much agitated; “and recently
      we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in
      the Rue Saint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these
      details?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a
      man of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the
      day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and
      whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba.
      There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a
      Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this
      mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is the man who
      says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where is this man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In prison, sire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the matter seems serious to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the
      midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my
      bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at
      your majesty’s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance
      of my devotion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said Louis XVIII., “was there not a marriage
      engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A conspiracy in these times,” said Louis XVIII., smiling,
      “is a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to
      an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our
      ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and
      the future. For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their
      vigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If Bonaparte
      landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could
      even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly
      territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the
      result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population.
      Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, here is M. Dandré!” cried de Blacas. At this instant the
      minister of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready
      to faint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his
      hand, restrained him.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the sight of
      this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently the table at which
      he was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What ails you, baron?” he exclaimed. “You appear quite
      aghast. Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told
      me, and M. de Villefort has just confirmed?” M. de Blacas moved
      suddenly towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the
      forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much
      more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him
      than that he should humiliate the prefect.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire”—stammered the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what is it?” asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police,
      giving way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the
      feet of Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you speak?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I
      can never forgive myself!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII., “I command you to speak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed
      on the 1st of March.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where? In Italy?” asked the king eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In France, sire,—at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf
      of Juan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan,
      two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you
      only acquired this information today, the 3rd of March! Well, sir, what
      you tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you
      have gone mad.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, sire, it is but too true!” Louis made a gesture of
      indescribable anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden
      blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In France!” he cried, “the usurper in France! Then they
      did not watch over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sire,” exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, “M. Dandré is
      not a man to be accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the
      minister of police has shared the general blindness, that is all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But”—said Villefort, and then suddenly checking
      himself, he was silent; then he continued, “Your pardon, sire,”
      he said, bowing, “my zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign
      to excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied Louis. “You alone
      forewarned us of the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the
      south; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be
      easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is
      advancing by Gap and Sisteron.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII. “Is
      he then advancing on Paris?” The minister of police maintained a
      silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And Dauphiné, sir?” inquired the king, of Villefort. “Do
      you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling
      in Dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The
      mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” murmured Louis, “he was well informed. And how
      many men had he with him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know, sire,” answered the minister of police.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on
      that point? Of course it is of no consequence,” he added, with a
      withering smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the
      fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how did this despatch reach you?” inquired the king. The
      minister bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he
      stammered out,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the telegraph, sire.”—Louis XVIII. advanced a step,
      and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.

    <p>
      “So then,” he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, “seven
      conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven
      replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of
      exile. I have, during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to
      understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to
      me; and now, when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the
      power I hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, it is fatality!” murmured the minister, feeling that
      the pressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too
      much for any human strength to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing,
      forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself;
      but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor,
      who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,—for
      my fortune is theirs—before me they were nothing—after me they
      will be nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity—ineptitude!
      Oh, yes, sir, you are right—it is fatality!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped
      the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt
      his increased importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To fall,” continued King Louis, who at the first glance had
      sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,—“to
      fall, and learn of that fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the
      scaffold of my brother, Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the
      Tuileries driven away by ridicule. Ridicule, sir—why, you know not
      its power in France, and yet you ought to know it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, sire,” murmured the minister, “for pity’s——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Approach, M. de Villefort,” resumed the king, addressing the
      young man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation
      on which depended the destiny of a kingdom. “Approach, and tell
      monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man
      concealed from all the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really impossible! Yes—that is a great word, sir.
      Unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; I have
      measured them. Really impossible for a minister who has an office, agents,
      spies, and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to
      know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well,
      then, see, here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his
      disposal—a gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more
      than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like
      you, he had the power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the
      minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who
      bent his head in modest triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not mean that for you, Blacas,” continued Louis XVIII.;
      “for if you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good
      sense to persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have
      considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else
      dictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the
      sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much
      confidence an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would,
      perhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but
      he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister,
      although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact, the minister,
      who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth Napoleon’s
      secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay
      bare the motives of Villefort’s plot. Realizing this, Villefort came
      to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of aiding to crush
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event
      must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence;
      what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity
      is simply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good
      and devoted servant—that’s all. Do not attribute to me more
      than I deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall
      the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister
      of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort
      understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that
      without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one
      on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis well,” resumed the king. “And now,
      gentlemen,” he continued, turning towards M. de Blacas and the
      minister of police, “I have no further occasion for you, and you may
      retire; what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of
      war.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fortunately, sire,” said M. de Blacas, “we can rely on
      the army; your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and
      attachment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence
      to place in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned
      with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort,
      unable to repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added,
      “Your pardon, sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me
      forget, not the respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my
      heart, but the rules of etiquette.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today
      earned the right to make inquiries here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a
      moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on
      this head, when your majesty’s attention was attracted by the
      terrible event that has occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will
      cease to interest your majesty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis
      XVIII., “this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with
      that which occupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will,
      perhaps, put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.”
      At the name of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister
      of police, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first
      believed, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left
      a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been with
      him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue
      Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing
      his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street
      mentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister
      related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung
      on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king
      looked towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel,
      whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely
      devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this
      all that is known?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On his track?” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from
      fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy
      eyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,
      buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an
      officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding
      with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the corner
      of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.” Villefort leaned
      on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of police went on speaking
      he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the unknown had
      escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he breathed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the
      minister of police; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General
      Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been
      murdered, his assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.”
      It required all Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with
      which this declaration of the king inspired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How strange,” continued the king, with some asperity; “the
      police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say,
      ‘A murder has been committed,’ and especially so when they can
      add, ‘And we are on the track of the guilty persons.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point
      at least.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you
      must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you
      stopped at your father’s?” A feeling of faintness came over
      Villefort.

      “No, sire,” he replied, “I alighted at the Hotel de
      Madrid, in the Rue de Tournon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you have seen him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you will see him, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think not, sire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I forgot,” said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved
      that all these questions were not made without a motive; “I forgot
      you and M. Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is
      another sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be
      recompensed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a
      recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing
      more to ask for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In
      the meanwhile” (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of
      Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St.
      Louis, above the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and
      gave it to Villefort)—“in the meanwhile take this cross.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” said Villefort, “your majesty mistakes; this is
      an officer’s cross.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi!</i>” said Louis XVIII., “take it, such as it
      is, for I have not the time to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your
      care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort.”
      Villefort’s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride; he took
      the cross and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now,” he said, “may I inquire what are the orders
      with which your majesty deigns to honor me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able
      to serve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at
      Marseilles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sire,” replied Villefort, bowing, “in an hour I shall
      have quitted Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, sir,” said the king; “and should I forget you
      (kings’ memories are short), do not be afraid to bring yourself to
      my recollection. Baron, send for the minister of war. Blacas, remain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, sir,” said the minister of police to Villefort, as they
      left the Tuileries, “you entered by luck’s door—your
      fortune is made.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will it be long first?” muttered Villefort, saluting the
      minister, whose career was ended, and looking about him for a
      hackney-coach. One passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his
      address to the driver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and
      gave loose to dreams of ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to be
      ready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him. He was
      about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud.
      The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard someone speak his name.

    <p>
      “Who could know that I was here already?” said the young man.
      The valet entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Villefort, “what is it?—Who rang?—Who
      asked for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A stranger who will not send in his name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A stranger who will not send in his name! What can he want with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He wishes to speak to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What sort of person is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, sir, a man of about fifty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Short or tall?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “About your own height, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dark or fair?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dark,—very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how dressed?” asked Villefort quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion
      of Honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is he!” said Villefort, turning pale.

      “Eh, <i>pardieu!</i>” said the individual whose description we
      have twice given, entering the door, “what a great deal of ceremony!
      Is it the custom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in
      their anterooms?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father!” cried Villefort, “then I was not deceived; I
      felt sure it must be you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, if you felt so sure,” replied the new-comer,
      putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair, “allow me to
      say, my dear Gérard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting
      at the door.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leave us, Germain,” said Villefort. The servant quitted the
      apartment with evident signs of astonishment.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. Noirtier—for
      it was, indeed, he who entered—looked after the servant until the
      door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might be overheard
      in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the precaution
      useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain, who proved that he
      was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents. M. Noirtier
      then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door, then that of
      the bedchamber, and then extended his hand to Villefort, who had followed
      all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, now, my dear Gérard,” said he to the young man, with a
      very significant look, “do you know, you seem as if you were not
      very glad to see me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear father,” said Villefort, “I am, on the
      contrary, delighted; but I so little expected your visit, that it has
      somewhat overcome me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, my dear fellow,” replied M. Noirtier, seating himself,
      “I might say the same thing to you, when you announce to me your
      wedding for the 28th of February, and on the 3rd of March you turn up here
      in Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if I have come, my dear father,” said Gérard, drawing
      closer to M. Noirtier, “do not complain, for it is for you that I
      came, and my journey will be your salvation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed!” said M. Noirtier, stretching himself out at his
      ease in the chair. “Really, pray tell me all about it, for it must
      be interesting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father, you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the
      Rue Saint-Jacques?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. 53; yes, I am vice-president.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father, your coolness makes me shudder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, my dear boy, when a man has been proscribed by the
      mountaineers, has escaped from Paris in a hay-cart, been hunted over the
      plains of Bordeaux by Robespierre’s bloodhounds, he becomes
      accustomed to most things. But go on, what about the club in the Rue
      Saint-Jacques?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, they induced General Quesnel to go there, and General Quesnel,
      who quitted his own house at nine o’clock in the evening, was found
      the next day in the Seine.”

    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not so loud, father, I entreat of you—for your own sake as
      well as mine. Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could;
      for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible
      speed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Three days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had
      not landed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No matter, I was aware of his intention.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did you know about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger.
      Had that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father,
      would probably ere this have been shot.” Villefort’s father
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come,” said he, “will the Restoration adopt
      imperial methods so promptly? Shot, my dear boy? What an idea! Where is
      the letter you speak of? I know you too well to suppose you would allow
      such a thing to pass you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that
      letter must have led to your condemnation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the destruction of your future prospects,” replied
      Noirtier; “yes, I can easily comprehend that. But I have nothing to
      fear while I have you to protect me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do better than that, sir—I save you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do? Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramatic—explain
      yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police. Why didn’t
      they search more vigilantly? they would have found——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They have not found; but they are on the track.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the
      police is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the
      government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a sneaking
      air, that the track is lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and
      in all countries they call that a murder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the
      general was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having
      thrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown
      himself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of
      January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of the
      word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who thus designated it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The king himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there
      was no murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well
      as I do, there are no men, but ideas—no feelings, but interests; in
      politics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.
      Would you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell you.
      It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was
      recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and
      invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends. He
      came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the
      projected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the
      fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at each
      other,—he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an ill
      grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and yet, in
      spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free—perfectly
      free. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear
      fellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that’s all. A murder?
      really, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found an
      accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were
      fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of my
      party, ‘My son, you have committed a murder?’ No, I said,
      ‘Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance,
      it will be our turn.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be
      sweeping.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You rely on the usurper’s return?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior
      of France without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow, the emperor is at this moment on the way to
      Grenoble; on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons, and on the 20th or 25th
      at Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The people will rise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, to go and meet him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched
      against him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, to escort him into the capital. Really, my dear Gérard, you
      are but a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph
      has told you, three days after the landing, ‘The usurper has landed
      at Cannes with several men. He is pursued.’ But where is he? what is
      he doing? You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to
      Paris, without drawing a trigger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities, and will oppose to him an
      impassable barrier.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm—all Lyons
      will hasten to welcome him. Believe me, we are as well informed as you,
      and our police are as good as your own. Would you like a proof of it?
      well, you wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your
      arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier. You gave your
      direction to no one but your postilion, yet I have your address, and in
      proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table. Ring,
      then, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will dine
      together.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed!” replied Villefort, looking at his father with
      astonishment, “you really do seem very well informed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the
      means that money produces—we who are in expectation, have those
      which devotion prompts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Devotion!” said Villefort, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful
      ambition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Villefort’s father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon
      the servant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait, my dear father,” said the young man, “one word
      more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one
      terrible thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when
      General Quesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? And what
      may be that description?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue
      frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion
      of Honor in his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, ha, that’s it, is it?” said Noirtier; “and
      why, then, have they not laid hands on him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the
      corner of the Rue Coq-Héron.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Didn’t I say that your police were good for nothing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but they may catch him yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, “true,
      if this person were not on his guard, as he is;” and he added with a
      smile, “He will consequently make a few changes in his personal
      appearance.” At these words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and
      cravat, went towards a table on which lay his son’s toilet articles,
      lathered his face, took a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the
      compromising whiskers. Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      His whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,
      instead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of
      an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned
      frock-coat, a coat of Villefort’s of dark brown, and cut away in
      front; tried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son’s,
      which appeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner
      where he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the air
      with it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger which was
      one of his principal characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this
      disguise was completed, “well, do you think your police will
      recognize me now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, father,” stammered Villefort; “at least, I hope
      not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now, my dear boy,” continued Noirtier, “I rely on
      your prudence to remove all the things which I leave in your care.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, rely on me,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really
      saved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.”
      Villefort shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are not convinced yet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall you see the king again?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second
      restoration, you would then pass for a great man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what should I say to the king?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say this to him: ‘Sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in
      France, as to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army;
      he whom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre, who at Nevers is styled the
      usurper, is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons, and emperor at
      Grenoble. You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing as
      rapidly as his own eagles. The soldiers you believe to be dying with
      hunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of snow
      about the rolling ball as it hastens onward. Sire, go, leave France to its
      real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but by right of
      conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your adversary is
      powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be humiliating for
      a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of Arcola, Marengo,
      Austerlitz.’ Tell him this, Gérard; or, rather, tell him nothing.
      Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have come to Paris to
      do, or have done; return with all speed; enter Marseilles at night, and
      your house by the back-door, and there remain, quiet, submissive, secret,
      and, above all, inoffensive; for this time, I swear to you, we shall act
      like powerful men who know their enemies. Go, my son—go, my dear
      Gérard, and by your obedience to my paternal orders, or, if you prefer it,
      friendly counsels, we will keep you in your place. This will be,”
      added Noirtier, with a smile, “one means by which you may a second
      time save me, if the political balance should some day take another turn,
      and cast you aloft while hurling me down. Adieu, my dear Gérard, and at
      your next journey alight at my door.” Noirtier left the room when he
      had finished, with the same calmness that had characterized him during the
      whole of this remarkable and trying conversation. Villefort, pale and
      agitated, ran to the window, put aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool
      and collected, by two or three ill-looking men at the corner of the
      street, who were there, perhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and
      a blue frock-coat, and hat with broad brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared at
      the Rue Bussy. Then he turned to the various articles he had left behind
      him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of the
      portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into small
      bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and calling his
      valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask,
      paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready, learned at Lyons
      that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst of the tumult which
      prevailed along the road, at length reached Marseilles, a prey to all the
      hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its
      first successes.

      Chapter 13. The Hundred Days
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. Noirtier was a
      true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had predicted. Everyone
      knows the history of the famous return from Elba, a return which was
      unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain without a counterpart
      in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the
      monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious
      foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of
      ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort, therefore,
      gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather likely to
      injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of Honor,
      which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had duly
      forwarded the brevet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it
      not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the
      Girondin of ‘93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately
      had been his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him
      to stifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s
      procureur alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is,
      scarcely had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue
      orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he
      found on the table there Louis XVIII.‘s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely
      had this occurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to
      rekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it
      required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence
      than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists
      whenever they ventured abroad.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we
      will not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a timid
      man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of Bonaparte
      accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential
      to make a demand in favor of Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more
      favorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard
      required a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII. returned,
      the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be vastly
      increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy-procureur
      was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one morning his
      door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man of
      ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made Morrel wait
      in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for the simple reason
      that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait, and after
      passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he ordered M. Morrel
      to be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had found
      him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial politeness,
      that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well-bred from the
      vulgar man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate
      would tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder
      all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his
      desk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door; Villefort
      gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him; then, after
      a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his
      hands,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of
      the hand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this
      visit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be
      delighted.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything depends on you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Explain yourself, pray.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he
      proceeded, “do you recollect that a few days before the landing of
      his majesty the emperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of
      my ship, who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the
      Island of Elba? What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor.
      You then served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor—it was
      your duty; today you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him—it
      is equally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. “What is his
      name?” said he. “Tell me his name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Edmond Dantès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol
      at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but he did not
      blanch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dantès,” repeated he, “Edmond Dantès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, monsieur.” Villefort opened a large register, then went
      to a table, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to
      Morrel,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?” said he,
      in the most natural tone in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these
      matters, he would have been surprised at the king’s procureur
      answering him on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors
      of the prison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed
      in his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other’s
      condescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Morrel; “I am not mistaken. I have known him
      for ten years, the last four of which he was in my service. Do not you
      recollect, I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come
      today to plead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists
      were very severe with the Bonapartists in those days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” returned Villefort, “I was then a royalist,
      because I believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the
      chosen of the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me,
      the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s right!” cried Morrel. “I like to hear you
      speak thus, and I augur well for Edmond from it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait a moment,” said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a
      register; “I have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young
      Catalan girl. I recollect now; it was a very serious charge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de
      Justice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he
      was carried off.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Carried off!” said Morrel. “What can they have done
      with him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the
      Sainte-Marguérite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take
      command of your vessel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is
      not already returned? It seems to me the first care of government should
      be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The
      order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his
      liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has
      scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been
      forwarded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all
      these formalities—of releasing him from arrest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There has been no arrest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s
      disappearance without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or
      documents may defeat their wishes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis
      XIV. The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis
      himself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register
      is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness
      would have dispelled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Petition the minister.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred
      petitions every day, and does not read three.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and
      presented by me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And will you undertake to deliver it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With the greatest pleasure. Dantès was then guilty, and now he is
      innocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him.”
      Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which, however
      improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him defenceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how shall I address the minister?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to
      Morrel, “and write what I dictate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you be so good?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be
      suffering.” Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone
      too far to draw back. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s
      ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention, no
      doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made
      out one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was
      evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly
      release him. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will the petition go soon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Countersigned by you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the
      contents of your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the
      certificate at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What more is to be done?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted
      Morrel, who took leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old
      Dantès that he would soon see his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved the
      petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an event
      that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès
      remained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XVIII.‘s
      throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice had
      Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo, and
      Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any fresh
      attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had
      become filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the situation
      of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards he
      married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher at
      court than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in his
      dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven. Danglars comprehended the full
      extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon
      returned to France, he, after the manner of mediocre minds, termed the
      coincidence, <i>a decree of Providence</i>. But when Napoleon returned to
      Paris, Danglars’ heart failed him, and he lived in constant fear of
      Dantès’ return on a mission of vengeance. He therefore informed M.
      Morrel of his wish to quit the sea, and obtained a recommendation from him
      to a Spanish merchant, into whose service he entered at the end of March,
      that is, ten or twelve days after Napoleon’s return. He then left
      for Madrid, and was no more heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fernand understood nothing except that Dantès was absent. What had become
      of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the absence of
      his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of deceiving
      Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of emigration and
      abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of
      Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and the Catalans are
      visible, watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man, who was
      for him also the messenger of vengeance. Fernand’s mind was made up;
      he would shoot Dantès, and then kill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a
      man of his disposition never kills himself, for he constantly hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man in
      France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor.
      Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible thought that
      while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercédès. Had
      Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done so when he parted
      from Mercédès. His devotion, and the compassion he showed for her
      misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce on noble minds—Mercédès
      had always had a sincere regard for Fernand, and this was now strengthened
      by gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My brother,” said she as she placed his knapsack on his
      shoulders, “be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall
      be alone in the world.” These words carried a ray of hope into
      Fernand’s heart. Should Dantès not return, Mercédès might one day be
      his.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never
      seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in
      tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute and
      motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times gazing
      on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself
      into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was not want of
      courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution; but her
      religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married and
      eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantès, who was
      only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon’s downfall. Five
      months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the hour of
      his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercédès’ arms. M. Morrel paid
      the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old man had
      contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the
      south was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of so
      dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.

    <h2>
      Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> year after Louis
      XVIII.‘s restoration, a visit was made by the inspector-general of
      prisons. Dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation,—sounds
      that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the
      ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash of the drop of water that
      every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon. He guessed something
      uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so long ceased to have
      any intercourse with the world, that he looked upon himself as dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of
      several of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended
      them to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed, and
      if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that the fare
      was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook their
      heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector turned
      smilingly to the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless
      visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,—always the same
      thing,—ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us visit them,” said the inspector with an air of
      fatigue. “We must play the farce to the end. Let us see the
      dungeons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us first send for two soldiers,” said the governor.
      “The prisoners sometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in
      order to be sentenced to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you
      might fall a victim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take all needful precautions,” replied the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended a
      stairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight, smell,
      and respiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” cried the inspector, “who can live here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most
      strict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long has he been there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nearly a year.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was he placed here when he first arrived?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food
      to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To kill the turnkey?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?”
      asked the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “True enough; he wanted to kill me!” returned the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must be mad,” said the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is worse than that,—he is a devil!” returned the
      turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I complain of him?” demanded the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in
      another year he will be quite so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the better for him,—he will suffer less,” said
      the inspector. He was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy,
      and in every way fit for his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, sir,” replied the governor; “and this
      remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in
      a dungeon about twenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another
      stair, an old abbé, formerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here
      since 1811, and in 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He
      used to weep, he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had
      better see him, for his madness is amusing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will see them both,” returned the inspector; “I must
      conscientiously perform my duty.” This was the inspector’s
      first visit; he wished to display his authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us visit this one first,” added he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “By all means,” replied the governor, and he signed to the
      turnkey to open the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and
      the creaking of the hinges, Dantès, who was crouched in a corner of the
      dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow
      iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted by two
      turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to whom the
      governor spoke bareheaded, Dantès, who guessed the truth, and that the
      moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come, sprang
      forward with clasped hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was about
      to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three steps.
      Dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing all the
      humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the inspector,
      and sought to inspire him with pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor,
      observed, “He will become religious—he is already more gentle;
      he is afraid, and retreated before the bayonets—madmen are not
      afraid of anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.”
      Then, turning to the prisoner, “What is it you want?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I want to know what crime I have committed—to be tried; and
      if I am guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you well fed?” said the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe so; I don’t know; it’s of no consequence.
      What matters really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the
      king, is that an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an
      infamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are very humble today,” remarked the governor; “you
      are not so always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the
      turnkey.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very
      good to me, but I was mad.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you are not so any longer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So long?—when were you arrested, then?” asked the
      inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Today is the 30th of July, 1816,—why it is but seventeen
      months.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only seventeen months,” replied Dantès. “Oh, you do not
      know what is seventeen months in prison!—seventeen ages rather,
      especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his
      ambition—to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a
      woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who
      loses all in an instant—who sees his prospects destroyed, and is
      ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be
      still living! Seventeen months’ captivity to a sailor accustomed to
      the boundless ocean, is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited.
      Have pity on me, then, and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not
      pardon, but a verdict—a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that,
      surely, cannot be denied to one who is accused!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We shall see,” said the inspector; then, turning to the
      governor, “On my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me
      the proofs against him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” continued Dantès, “I know it is not in your
      power to release me; but you can plead for me—you can have me tried—and
      that is all I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was
      condemned. Uncertainty is worse than all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on with the lights,” said the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” cried Dantès, “I can tell by your voice you
      are touched with pity; tell me at least to hope.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot tell you that,” replied the inspector; “I can
      only promise to examine into your case.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I am free—then I am saved!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who arrested you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am no longer surprised at my detention,” murmured Dantès,
      “since my only protector is removed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Entirely.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is well; wait patiently, then.” Dantès fell on his
      knees, and prayed earnestly. The door closed; but this time a fresh inmate
      was left with Dantès—hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you see the register at once,” asked the governor,
      “or proceed to the other cell?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us visit them all,” said the inspector. “If I once
      went up those stairs. I should never have the courage to come down again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less
      affecting than this one’s display of reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is his folly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he
      offered government a million of francs for his release; the second, two;
      the third, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of
      captivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five
      millions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How curious!—what is his name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Abbé Faria.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. 27,” said the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.” The turnkey obeyed,
      and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the <i>mad abbé</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster
      detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered
      him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed as much
      absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus
      slew him.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      He did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations
      until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the
      sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with
      astonishment the number of persons present. He hastily seized the coverlet
      of his bed, and wrapped it round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it you want?” said the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I, monsieur,” replied the abbé with an air of surprise—“I
      want nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not understand,” continued the inspector; “I am
      sent here by government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the
      prisoners.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that is different,” cried the abbé; “and we shall
      understand each other, I hope.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, now,” whispered the governor, “it is just as I
      told you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” continued the prisoner, “I am the Abbé
      Faria, born at Rome. I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada’s
      secretary; I was arrested, why, I know not, toward the beginning of the
      year 1811; since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and
      French government.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why from the French government?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan
      and Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the inspector, “you have not the latest news
      from Italy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,”
      returned the Abbé Faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom
      of Rome for his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of
      Machiavelli and Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” returned the inspector, “providence has
      changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and
      independent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to
      inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The food is the same as in other prisons,—that is, very bad;
      the lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a
      dungeon; but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have
      to reveal of the greatest importance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are coming to the point,” whispered the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,” continued
      the abbé, “although you have disturbed me in a most important
      calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton’s
      system. Could you allow me a few words in private.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did I tell you?” said the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You knew him,” returned the inspector with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What you ask is impossible, monsieur,” continued he,
      addressing Faria.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said the abbé, “I would speak to you of a large
      sum, amounting to five millions.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “The very sum you named,” whispered the inspector in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “However,” continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was
      about to depart, “it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone;
      the governor can be present.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately,” said the governor, “I know beforehand
      what you are about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?”
      Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced
      anyone else of his sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course,” said he; “of what else should I speak?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mr. Inspector,” continued the governor, “I can tell you
      the story as well as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last
      four or five years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That proves,” returned the abbé, “that you are like
      those of Holy Writ, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your
      treasures,” replied the inspector; “keep them until you are
      liberated.” The abbé’s eyes glistened; he seized the inspector’s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what if I am not liberated,” cried he, “and am
      detained here until my death? this treasure will be lost. Had not
      government better profit by it? I will offer six millions, and I will
      content myself with the rest, if they will only give me my liberty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On my word,” said the inspector in a low tone, “had I
      not been told beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he
      says.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not mad,” replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing
      peculiar to prisoners. “The treasure I speak of really exists, and I
      offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the
      spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,—I
      ask no more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor laughed. “Is the spot far from here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A hundred leagues.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not ill-planned,” said the governor. “If all the
      prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their
      guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of
      escaping.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The scheme is well known,” said the inspector; “and the
      abbé’s plan has not even the merit of originality.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to Faria—“I inquired if you are well fed?”
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell
      you prove true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so
      there is no chance of my escaping.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept
      my gold; I will keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will
      give it me.” And the abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his
      place, and continued his calculations.
    </p>

    <p>
      “What is he doing there?” said the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They
      went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich,
      he would not have been here.” So the matter ended for the Abbé
      Faria. He remained in his cell, and this visit only increased the belief
      in his insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the
      impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his
      wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern
      times, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither courage
      nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the eye that
      scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves sprung from
      Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are not
      inviolable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer
      the victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition rarely
      allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh
      lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its cell, from
      whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital, where
      the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the
      jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the Abbé Faria, gone mad in
      prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and
      found the following note concerning him:—
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Edmond Dantès:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Violent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.
    </p>
    <p>
      This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it had
      been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend against
      this accusation; he simply wrote, <i>Nothing to be done.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then, forgotten
      the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the date, 30th
      July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose his reckoning
      again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès still waited;
      he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This fortnight expired,
      he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris,
      and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished, he
      therefore fixed three months; three months passed away, then six more.
      Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had
      taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the inspector’s visit but a
      dream, an illusion of the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had obtained
      charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his
      subordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor
      arrived; it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the
      prisoners; he learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained
      fifty cells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their
      cell, and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he
      was now number 34.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>antes passed
      through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense. He was
      sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the
      sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence, which
      justified in some measure the governor’s belief in his mental
      alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his
      supplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the last resource.
      Unfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have any hope in him
      till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another; for a
      change, however disadvantageous, was still a change, and would afford him
      some amusement. He entreated to be allowed to walk about, to have fresh
      air, books, and writing materials. His requests were not granted, but he
      went on asking all the same. He accustomed himself to speaking to the new
      jailer, although the latter was, if possible, more taciturn than the old
      one; but still, to speak to a man, even though mute, was something. Dantès
      spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when
      alone, but the sound of his voice terrified him. Often, before his
      captivity, Dantès’ mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of
      prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers. He now wished to
      be amongst them, in order to see some other face besides that of his
      jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the infamous costume, the chain,
      and the brand on the shoulder. The galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of
      heaven, and saw each other. They were very happy. He besought the jailer
      one day to let him have a companion, were it even the mad abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much
      suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he had often had a
      feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid
      the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently
      imagined that Dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and refused
      his request. Dantès had exhausted all human resources, and he then turned
      to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he
      recollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new
      meaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of
      words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands
      the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of
      heaven! He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at the sound of
      his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy. He laid every action of
      his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to accomplish, and at the end
      of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to
      God: “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass
      against us.” Yet in spite of his earnest prayers, Dantès remained a
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then gloom settled heavily upon him. Dantès was a man of great simplicity
      of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore, in the
      solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history of the
      ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild the ancient
      cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination, and that
      pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martin’s
      Babylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past life was so
      short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so doubtful. Nineteen
      years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness! No distraction could
      come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would have exalted in thus
      revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage. He clung to
      one idea—that of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause,
      by an unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea,
      devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of
      Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rage supplanted religious fervor. Dantès uttered blasphemies that made his
      jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the walls of
      his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon himself,
      so that the least thing,—a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath of
      air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the letter that
      Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed
      forth in fiery letters on the wall like the <i>mene, mene, tekel upharsin</i>
      of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity of man, and not the
      vengeance of heaven, that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery. He
      consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could
      imagine, and found them all insufficient, because after torture came
      death, and after death, if not repose, at least the boon of
      unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death,
      and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be
      invented, he began to reflect on suicide. Unhappy he, who, on the brink of
      misfortune, broods over ideas like these!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye; but
      he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with
      a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once thus ensnared,
      unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is over, and his
      struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This state of mental anguish
      is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the
      punishment that possibly will follow. There is a sort of consolation at
      the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of which lie
      darkness and obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his
      sufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell when
      the angel of death seemed about to enter. Dantès reviewed his past life
      with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future existence,
      chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sometimes,” said he, “in my voyages, when I was a man
      and commanded other men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage
      and foam, the storm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two
      horizons with its wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge,
      that trembled and shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and
      the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death
      then terrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a
      sailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was
      happy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed of
      rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a
      creature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the gulls
      and ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound me to
      life, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own manner, I
      die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I have paced
      three thousand times round my cell.”
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more
      composed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and
      slept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that
      he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two methods of
      self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself with his
      handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation. But
      the first was repugnant to him. Dantès had always entertained the greatest
      horror of pirates, who are hung up to the yard-arm; he would not die by
      what seemed an infamous death. He resolved to adopt the second, and began
      that day to carry out his resolve. Nearly four years had passed away; at
      the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Dantès said, “I wish to die,” and had chosen the manner of his
      death, and fearful of changing his mind, he had taken an oath to die.
      “When my morning and evening meals are brought,” thought he,
      “I will cast them out of the window, and they will think that I have
      eaten them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture,
      the provisions his jailer brought him—at first gayly, then with
      deliberation, and at last with regret. Nothing but the recollection of his
      oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once repugnant, now
      acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed
      thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and
      mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life contending with the
      resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre, his prospects
      less desperate. He was still young—he was only four or five and
      twenty—he had nearly fifty years to live. What unforseen events
      might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty? Then he raised
      to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary Tantalus, he refused
      himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would not break it. He
      persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast
      his supper out of the loophole. The next morning he could not see or hear;
      the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him
      which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at his
      stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes he saw
      myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o’-the-wisps
      that play about the marshes. It was the twilight of that mysterious
      country called Death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, about nine o’clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow
      sound in the wall against which he was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did not,
      in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties,
      or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond raised his head
      and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made by a huge claw, a
      powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although weakened, the young man’s brain instantly responded to the
      idea that haunts all prisoners—liberty! It seemed to him that heaven
      had at length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on
      the very brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so
      often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the
      distance that separated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams that
      forerun death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then heard
      a noise of something falling, and all was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond was
      intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that he
      had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the attendant,
      had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him, and
      turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now
      the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it, and so destroy a ray
      of something like hope that soothed his last moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer brought him his breakfast. Dantès raised himself up and began
      to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the
      coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an
      excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who
      out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, he fancied that Dantès was delirious; and placing the food on
      the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound became more
      and more distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There can be no doubt about it,” thought he; “it is
      some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only
      there to help him!” Suddenly another idea took possession of his
      mind, so used to misfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hope—the
      idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair
      the neighboring dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It was
      easy to call his jailer’s attention to the noise, and watch his
      countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy hopes
      far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own curiosity?
      Unfortunately, Edmond’s brain was still so feeble that he could not
      bend his thoughts to anything in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment.
      He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose,
      staggered towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the
      contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure. He had often heard that
      shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much
      food. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour, and
      returned to his couch—he did not wish to die. He soon felt that his
      ideas became again collected—he could think, and strengthen his
      thoughts by reasoning. Then he said to himself, “I must put this to
      the test, but without compromising anybody. If it is a workman, I need but
      knock against the wall, and he will cease to work, in order to find out
      who is knocking, and why he does so; but as his occupation is sanctioned
      by the governor, he will soon resume it. If, on the contrary, it is a
      prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him, he will cease, and not begin
      again until he thinks everyone is asleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight
      was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and with
      it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck thrice. At the
      first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no sound
      was heard from the wall—all was silent there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and,
      thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh
      recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed away in utter silence—night came without recurrence
      of the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a prisoner,” said Edmond joyfully. The night passed in
      perfect silence. Edmond did not close his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions—he had
      already devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening
      anxiously for the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the
      iron bars of the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by
      exercise, and so preparing himself for his future destiny. At intervals he
      listened to learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient at
      the prudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been disturbed by a
      captive as anxious for liberty as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days passed—seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted
      off by minutes!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time
      that night, Dantès, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall,
      fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He
      moved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and then
      went back and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other side
      of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had substituted a
      lever for a chisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the
      indefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around for
      anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist cement,
      and displace a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating
      was of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All his
      furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug. The bed
      had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it would have
      required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and chair had nothing,
      the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had been removed.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Dantès had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one of
      the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the floor, and
      it broke in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed,
      leaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural an
      accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in, but in
      the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was working
      against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited for day.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his
      way. Day came, the jailer entered. Dantès told him that the jug had fallen
      from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went grumblingly to
      fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments
      of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised the prisoner to be more
      careful, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the
      sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by the
      faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored uselessly
      the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the
      plaster that surrounded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damp had rendered it friable, and Dantès was able to break it off—in
      small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had scraped
      off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years,
      supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty feet long
      and two feet broad, might be formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he
      had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six years
      that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?
    </p>
    <p>
      In three days he had succeeded, with the utmost precaution, in removing
      the cement, and exposing the stone-work. The wall was built of rough
      stones, among which, to give strength to the structure, blocks of hewn
      stone were at intervals imbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered,
      and which he must remove from its socket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The
      fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive
      until his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea occurred
      to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer always brought Dantès’ soup in an iron saucepan; this
      saucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dantès had noticed that it
      was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave it to
      him or to his companion first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantès would have given ten years
      of his life in exchange for it.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

      <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/images/0191.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img src="./The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas [père]_files/enlarge.jpg" alt=""> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dantès’
      plate, and Dantès, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon, washed the
      plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening came Dantès put
      his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as he entered, stepped
      on it and broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he could not blame Dantès. He was wrong to leave it there, but
      the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer, therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something
      to pour the soup into; Dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of
      one plate—there was no alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leave the saucepan,” said Dantès; “you can take it away
      when you bring me my breakfast.” This advice was to the jailer’s
      taste, as it spared him the necessity of making another trip. He left the
      saucepan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and
      after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and return,
      he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted the point
      between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and employed it as a
      lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went well. At the end
      of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall, leaving a cavity a foot
      and a half in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of his
      cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use of his
      time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work without
      ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his bed against
      the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread; the
      jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?” said
      Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the turnkey; “you destroy everything.
      First you break your jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the
      prisoners followed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall
      leave you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I
      hope you will not be so destructive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the
      coverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron
      than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that the
      prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was a
      greater reason for proceeding—if his neighbor would not come to him,
      he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the
      evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and
      fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer’s visit arrived,
      Dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and
      placed it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup
      into it, together with the fish—for thrice a week the prisoners were
      deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had not
      Dantès long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey
      retired. Dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased
      to work. He listened—all was silent, as it had been for the last
      three days. Dantès sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted
      him. However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but
      after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no
      impression, but met with a smooth surface; Dantès touched it, and found
      that it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole
      Dantès had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it.
      The unhappy young man had not thought of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “O my God, my God!” murmured he, “I have so earnestly
      prayed to you, that I hoped my prayers had been heard. After having
      deprived me of my liberty, after having deprived me of death, after having
      recalled me to existence, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die
      in despair!”

    <p>
      “Who talks of God and despair at the same time?” said a voice
      that seemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance,
      sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man’s ears. Edmond’s
      hair stood on end, and he rose to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said he, “I hear a human voice.” Edmond had
      not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years; and a
      jailer is no man to a prisoner—he is a living door, a barrier of
      flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the name of heaven,” cried Dantès, “speak again,
      though the sound of your voice terrifies me. Who are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you?” said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who made no hesitation
      in answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of what country?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Frenchman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Edmond Dantès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your profession?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A sailor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long have you been here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Since the 28th of February, 1815.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your crime?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am innocent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But of what are you accused?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of having conspired to aid the emperor’s return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What! For the emperor’s return?—the emperor is no
      longer on the throne, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island
      of Elba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all
      this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Since 1811.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in
      prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not dig any more,” said the voice; “only tell me how
      high up is your excavation?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On a level with the floor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is it concealed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Behind my bed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What does your chamber open on?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A corridor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the corridor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On a court.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas!” murmured the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, what is the matter?” cried Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the
      wrong angle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took
      the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But then you would be close to the sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what I hoped.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And supposing you had succeeded?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands
      near here—the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen—and then I
      should have been safe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Could you have swum so far?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and
      wait until you hear from me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me, at least, who you are?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am—I am No. 27.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You mistrust me, then,” said Dantès. Edmond fancied he heard
      a bitter laugh resounding from the depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I am a Christian,” cried Dantès, guessing instinctively
      that this man meant to abandon him. “I swear to you by him who died
      for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers;
      but I conjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have
      got to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against the
      wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been
      here. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested, the
      28th of February, 1815.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not quite twenty-six!” murmured the voice; “at that age
      he cannot be a traitor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, no,” cried Dantès. “I swear to you again,
      rather than betray you, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I
      was about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me.
      I will not forget you. Wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me
      come to you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you of
      those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love somebody?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I am alone in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if
      you are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he yet
      lives; I only love him and a young girl called Mercédès. My father has not
      yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves me still; I
      shall love you as I loved my father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is well,” returned the voice; “tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his
      sincerity; Dantès rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution
      as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then gave himself
      up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was, perhaps, about
      to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a companion, and
      captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints made in common are
      almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are gathered together
      invoke the mercy of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day Dantès walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally on
      his bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he bounded
      towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might
      be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already; and then his mind
      was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the
      opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would be condemned to
      die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous
      noise recalled him to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer came in the evening. Dantès was on his bed. It seemed to him
      that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was a
      strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, “Come, are you
      going mad again?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would
      betray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dantès
      hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but he
      was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed from
      the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it you?” said he; “I am here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is your jailer gone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Dantès; “he will not return until the
      evening; so that we have twelve hours before us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can work, then?” said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment that part of the floor on which Dantès was resting his two
      hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he
      drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole
      that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from the
      bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to measure,
      he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly the body of
      a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.

      the friend so long and ardently desired, Dantès almost carried him towards
      the window, in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of
      the imperfect light that struggled through the grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of small stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering and
      sorrow than by age. He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost buried
      beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black) beard
      reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by care, and
      the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a man more
      accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength.
      Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow, while the
      garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at
      the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a certain
      briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that
      he was aged more from captivity than the course of time. He received the
      enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure, as
      though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his
      contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him with grateful
      cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at that moment have
      been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly
      reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us first see,” said he, “whether it is possible to
      remove the traces of my entrance here—our future tranquillity
      depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it.” Advancing
      to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its
      weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no
      tools to aid you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” exclaimed Dantès, with astonishment, “do you
      possess any?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all
      that are necessary,—a chisel, pincers, and lever.”

    <p>
      “Oh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and
      patience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.” So saying, he
      displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of beechwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And with what did you contrive to make that?” inquired
      Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has
      sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of
      about fifty feet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fifty feet!” responded Dantès, almost terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not speak so loud, young man—don’t speak so loud. It
      frequently occurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed
      outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of
      the prisoners.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But they believe I am shut up alone here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That makes no difference.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get
      here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from
      mine; only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the
      necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion,
      instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty. I expected,
      as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw
      myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which
      your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is all in vain,
      for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the corridor you
      speak of only bounds <i>one</i> side of my cell; there are three others—do
      you know anything of their situation?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten
      experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many years
      to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governor’s
      apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get into
      some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The fourth
      and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute,
      now where does it face?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by
      which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which gradually
      diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening through
      which a child could not have passed, was, for better security, furnished
      with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of
      the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner’s
      escape. As the stranger asked the question, he dragged the table beneath
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Climb up,” said he to Dantès. The young man obeyed, mounted
      on the table, and, divining the wishes of his companion, placed his back
      securely against the wall and held out both hands. The stranger, whom as
      yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell, sprang up with an agility
      by no means to be expected in a person of his years, and, light and steady
      on his feet as a cat or a lizard, climbed from the table to the
      outstretched hands of Dantès, and from them to his shoulders; then,
      bending double, for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding
      himself erect, he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the
      window, so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, “I
      thought so!” and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously
      as he had ascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was it that you thought?” asked the young man anxiously,
      in his turn descending from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder prisoner pondered the matter. “Yes,” said he at
      length, “it is so. This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind
      of open gallery, where patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep
      watch day and night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you quite sure of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certain. I saw the soldier’s shape and the top of his musket;
      that made me draw in my head so quickly, for I was fearful he might also
      see me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?” inquired Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your
      dungeon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” pursued the young man eagerly—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” answered the elder prisoner, “the will of God be
      done!” and as the old man slowly pronounced those words, an air of
      profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance. Dantès
      gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and
      ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?” said he at
      length; “never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Willingly,” answered the stranger; “if, indeed, you
      feel any curiosity respecting one, now, alas, powerless to aid you in any
      way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your
      own powerful mind. Pray let me know who you really are?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled a melancholy smile. “Then listen,” said
      he. “I am the Abbé Faria, and have been imprisoned as you know in
      this Château d’If since the year 1811; previously to which I had
      been confined for three years in the fortress of Fenestrelle. In the year
      1811 I was transferred to Piedmont in France. It was at this period I
      learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by
      Napoleon, had bestowed on him a son, named king of Rome even in his
      cradle. I was very far then from expecting the change you have just
      informed me of; namely, that four years afterwards, this colossus of power
      would be overthrown. Then who reigns in France at this moment—Napoleon
      II.?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Louis XVIII.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The brother of Louis XVI.! How inscrutable are the ways of
      providence—for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased
      heaven to abase the man once so elevated, and raise up him who was so
      abased?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès’ whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget
      his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes,” continued he, “‘Twill be the same as
      it was in England. After Charles I., Cromwell; after Cromwell, Charles
      II., and then James II., and then some son-in-law or relation, some Prince
      of Orange, a stadtholder who becomes a king. Then new concessions to the
      people, then a constitution, then liberty. Ah, my friend!” said the
      abbé, turning towards Dantès, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of
      a prophet, “you are young, you will see all this come to pass.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Probably, if ever I get out of prison!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” replied Faria, “we are prisoners; but I forget
      this sometimes, and there are even moments when my mental vision
      transports me beyond these walls, and I fancy myself at liberty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But wherefore are you here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to
      realize in 1811; because, like Machiavelli, I desired to alter the
      political face of Italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a
      quantity of petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical
      ruler, I sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and,
      lastly, because I fancied I had found my Cæsar Borgia in a crowned
      simpleton, who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me. It was
      the plan of Alexander VI. and Clement VII., but it will never succeed now,
      for they attempted it fruitlessly, and Napoleon was unable to complete his
      work. Italy seems fated to misfortune.” And the old man bowed his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters.
      Napoleon certainly he knew something of, inasmuch as he had seen and
      spoken with him; but of Clement VII. and Alexander VI. he knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you not,” he asked, “the priest who here in the
      Château d’If is generally thought to be—ill?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mad, you mean, don’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not like to say so,” answered Dantès, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” resumed Faria with a bitter smile, “let me
      answer your question in full, by acknowledging that I am the poor mad
      prisoner of the Château d’If, for many years permitted to amuse the
      different visitors with what is said to be my insanity; and, in all
      probability, I should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the
      children, if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like
      this to suffering and despair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless; at length he said,—“Then
      you abandon all hope of escape?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I perceive its utter impossibility; and I consider it impious to
      attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, be not discouraged. Would it not be expecting too much to hope
      to succeed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in
      another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me
      to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning
      over again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I
      possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard as
      granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge
      stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days have I
      passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid if, by
      night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard-bound
      cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones
      themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up, I was
      compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the fruits of my labor
      into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so completely choked up,
      that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust
      without leading to discovery. Consider also that I fully believed I had
      accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking, for which I had so exactly
      husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my
      enterprise; and now, at the moment when I reckoned upon success, my hopes
      are forever dashed from me. No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce
      me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almighty’s
      pleasure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the
      thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the
      failure of the abbé’s plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé sank upon Edmond’s bed, while Edmond himself remained
      standing. Escape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed, some
      things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for
      an instant. To undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote three
      years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice
      overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height of
      fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to
      pieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have
      escaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils
      past, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three
      miles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling
      and formidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme,
      resigning himself rather to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage,
      gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new courage.
      Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he had not had
      sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only because of an
      error in calculation. This same person, with almost incredible patience
      and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite
      for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done all this; why, then, was
      it impossible to Dantès? Faria had dug his way through fifty feet, Dantès
      would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of fifty, had devoted three years
      to the task; he, who was but half as old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a
      priest and savant, had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by
      trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands—Daume,
      Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a hardy sailor, an experienced diver, like
      himself, shrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere
      amusement’s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the
      bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project? He could do
      it in an hour, and how many times had he, for pure pastime, continued in
      the water for more than twice as long! At once Dantès resolved to follow
      the brave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what
      has once been done may be done again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After continuing some time in profound meditation, the young man suddenly
      exclaimed, “I have found what you were in search of!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Faria started: “Have you, indeed?” cried he, raising his head
      with quick anxiety; “pray, let me know what it is you have
      discovered?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell
      you occupy here, extends in the same direction as the outer gallery, does
      it not?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “It does.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And is not above fifteen feet from it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “About that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, I will tell you what we must do. We must pierce through
      the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the
      top part of a cross. This time you will lay your plans more accurately; we
      shall get out into the gallery you have described; kill the sentinel who
      guards it, and make our escape. All we require to insure success is
      courage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient in;
      as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours—you shall now see
      me prove mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One instant, my dear friend,” replied the abbé; “it is
      clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am
      endowed, and what use I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I
      consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning
      the task of the night before, and every night renewing the task of the
      day. But then, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full
      attention), then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to
      the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty—one who
      had committed no offence, and merited not condemnation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have your notions changed?” asked Dantès with much
      surprise; “do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt
      since you have encountered me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied
      myself merely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it
      no sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so
      easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.” A
      slight movement of surprise escaped Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible,” said he, “that where your liberty is
      at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me,” replied Faria, “what has hindered you from
      knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead,
      dressing yourself in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,” answered
      Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because,” said the old man, “the natural repugnance to
      the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so
      it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts
      keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose
      nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of
      smell to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this
      instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to
      spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of blood—it
      is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking
      dread of taking life; his natural construction and physiological formation——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which
      had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there are
      two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and those
      that emanate from the heart.

      “Since my imprisonment,” said Faria, “I have thought
      over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record. They have rarely
      been successful. Those that have been crowned with full success have been
      long meditated upon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the
      escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Château de Vincennes, that of the
      Abbé Dubuquoi from For l’Evêque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then
      there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those
      are the best of all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable
      moment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Dantès, “you might well endure the tedious
      delay; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when
      weary with toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to
      that source for recreation or support.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did you do then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wrote or studied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made
      for myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You made paper, pens and ink?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.
      Faria saw this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said
      he, “I will show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and
      reflections of my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of
      the Colosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice,
      and on the borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time
      that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If.
      The work I speak of is called <i>A Treatise on the Possibility of a
      General Monarchy in Italy</i>, and will make one large quarto volume.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And on what have you written all this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as
      smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are, then, a chemist?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after
      reading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and fifty
      well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of all human
      knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I devoted three years
      of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes,
      till I knew them nearly by heart; so that since I have been in prison, a
      very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as
      readily as though the pages were open before me. I could recite you the
      whole of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada,
      Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and
      Bossuet. I name only the most important.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as
      to have been able to read all these?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say,
      German, French, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek
      I learned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could
      wish, but I am still trying to improve myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you
      manage to do so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and
      arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their
      medium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is absolutely
      necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the
      dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I certainly should have
      no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes; and that would be quite
      as much as I should ever require.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Stronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do with
      one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some
      imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he
      added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage
      to write the work you speak of?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally
      preferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings
      are served to us on <i>maigre</i> days. Well, I selected the cartilages of
      the heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight with
      which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, as
      affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for I will freely
      confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief.
      While retracing the past, I forget the present; and traversing at will the
      path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a prisoner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did you make your
      ink?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,” replied Faria,
      “but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison.
      Still, it must have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered
      with a coating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine
      brought to me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be
      desired. For very important notes, for which closer attention is required,
      I pricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when,” asked Dantès, “may I see all this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whenever you please,” replied the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the
      subterranean passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantès.

    <h2>
      Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter having passed
      with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage, which, however, did
      not admit of their holding themselves erect, the two friends reached the
      further end of the corridor, into which the abbé’s cell opened; from
      that point the passage became much narrower, and barely permitted one to
      creep through on hands and knees. The floor of the abbé’s cell was
      paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure
      corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which
      Dantès had witnessed the completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager and
      searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than
      common met his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before
      us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.”
      Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the
      abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said
      the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by
      means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of
      the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to
      ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a
      watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the
      sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always
      imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in
      the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement of
      the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to
      him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion’s
      lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging
      out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which
      he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his
      earliest youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your
      treasures.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the
      help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth,
      beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe
      depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “What do you wish to see first?” asked the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen,
      laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls consisted of
      slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all
      carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that
      Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being
      in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There,” said he, “there is the work complete. I wrote
      the word <i>finis</i> at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week
      ago. I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was
      master of, to complete the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison
      and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have
      composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see,” answered Dantès. “Now let me behold the curious
      pens with which you have written your work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look!” said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick
      about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a
      fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread,
      one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it
      was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dantès examined
      it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with
      which it had been shaped so correctly into form.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife. That’s my
      masterpiece. I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron
      candlestick.” The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the
      other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut
      and thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention
      that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the
      shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from
      whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for the ink,” said Faria, “I told you how I managed
      to obtain that—and I only just make it from time to time, as I
      require it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that
      is how you managed to do all this by daylight?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I worked at night also,” replied Faria.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Night!—why, for heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’,
      that you can see to work in the dark?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence
      that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I
      furnished myself with a light.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You did? Pray tell me how.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so
      made oil—here is my lamp.” So saying, the abbé exhibited a
      sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But light?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And matches?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a
      little sulphur, which was readily supplied.” Dantès laid the
      different things he had been looking at on the table, and stood with his
      head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and
      strength of Faria’s mind.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      “You have not seen all yet,” continued Faria, “for I did
      not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let
      us shut this one up.” They put the stone back in its place; the abbé
      sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been
      removed, rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance
      as the other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot
      it stood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting
      in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this
      space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.
      Dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and
      compact enough to bear any weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the
      sheets of my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at
      Fenestrelle; and when I was removed to the Château d’If, I managed
      to bring the ravellings with me, so that I have been able to finish my
      work here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed
      the edges over again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged
      vestments, he showed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small
      perforated eye for the thread, a small portion of which still remained in
      it. “I once thought,” continued Faria, “of removing
      these iron bars, and letting myself down from the window, which, as you
      see, is somewhat wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it
      still more preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should
      merely have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced
      the project altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I
      carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen
      opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance
      frequently brings about.” While affecting to be deeply engaged in
      examining the ladder, the mind of Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by
      the idea that a person so intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the
      abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own
      misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing
      the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his
      awe and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was reflecting, in the first place,” replied Dantès,
      “upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have
      employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What
      would you not have accomplished if you had been free?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably,
      in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune
      is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.
      Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my
      mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the
      collision of clouds electricity is produced—from electricity,
      lightning, from lightning, illumination.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Dantès. “I know nothing. Some of your
      words are to me quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to
      possess the knowledge you have.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé smiled. “Well,” said he, “but you had another
      subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have told me as yet but one of them—let me hear the
      other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was this,—that while you had related to me all the
      particulars of your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to
      admit of your having passed through any very important events.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved
      misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer
      vent reproaches upon heaven.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me
      upon earth,—my father and Mercédès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing
      the bed back to its original situation, “let me hear your story.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which
      consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three
      voyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise,
      with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet to be
      delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that
      personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter
      addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier—his arrival at Marseilles, and
      interview with his father—his affection for Mercédès, and their
      nuptual feast—his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary
      detention at the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the
      Château d’If. From this point everything was a blank to Dantès—he
      knew nothing more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His
      recital finished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is,” said he, at the end of his meditations, “a
      clever maxim, which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while
      ago, and that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally
      depraved mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at
      crime. Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants,
      vices, and false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to
      stifle within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt
      and wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if
      you visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover
      the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way
      advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,—to whom could your
      disappearance have been serviceable?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To no one, by heaven! I was a very insignificant person.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor
      philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king
      who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his
      rival out of a place. Now, in the event of the king’s death, his
      successor inherits a crown,—when the employee dies, the
      supernumerary steps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve
      thousand livres. Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list,
      and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king. Everyone,
      from the highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder,
      and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes’
      theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces increase as we go
      higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon
      the apex and not on the base. Now let us return to your particular world.
      You say you were on the point of being made captain of the <i>Pharaon</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the
      accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question
      as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of
      the <i>Pharaon</i>. What say you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board,
      and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves,
      I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one
      person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had
      quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to
      fight me; but he refused.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now we are getting on. And what was this man’s name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What rank did he hold on board?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was supercargo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his
      employment?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently
      observed inaccuracies in his accounts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your
      last conversation with Captain Leclere?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; we were quite alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It might, for the cabin door was open—and—stay; now I
      recollect,—Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was
      giving me the packet for the grand marshal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on
      the right scent. Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port
      of Elba?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nobody.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place
      of it, I think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; the grand marshal did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did you do with that letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Put it into my portfolio.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find
      room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official
      letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right; it was left on board.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the
      letter in the portfolio?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did you do with this same letter while returning from
      Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I carried it in my hand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that when you went on board the <i>Pharaon</i>, everybody could
      see that you held a letter in your hand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Danglars, as well as the rest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Danglars, as well as others.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending
      your arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against
      you was formulated?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into
      my memory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Repeat it to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès paused a moment, then said, “This is it, word for word:
      ‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and
      religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the <i>Pharaon</i>, this
      day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo,
      has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the
      usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of
      his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be
      found either about his person, at his father’s residence, or in his
      cabin on board the <i>Pharaon</i>.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The thing is clear as day,”
      said he; “and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as
      a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did Danglars usually write?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In a handsome, running hand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how was the anonymous letter written?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Backhanded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the abbé smiled. “Disguised.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was very boldly written, if disguised.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen,
      and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,
      with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation. Dantès
      drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How very astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your
      writing exactly resembles that of the accusation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand;
      and I have noticed that——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That while the writing of different persons done with the right
      hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have evidently seen and observed everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us proceed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now as regards the second question.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am listening.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage
      with Mercédès?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; a young man who loved her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And his name was——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fernand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is a Spanish name, I think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was a Catalan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You imagine him capable of writing the letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife
      into me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an
      assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice,
      never.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances
      mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To no one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not even to your mistress?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, not even to my betrothed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then it is Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I feel quite sure of it now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No—yes, he was. Now I recollect——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at
      Père Pamphile’s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding.
      They were in earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way,
      but Fernand looked pale and agitated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were they alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and
      who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named
      Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!—stay!—How strange
      that it should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well,
      that on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.
      Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed Dantès,
      pressing his hand to his throbbing brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the
      villany of your friends?” inquired the abbé with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes,” replied Dantès eagerly; “I would beg of you,
      who see so completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest
      mystery seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I
      underwent no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above
      all, was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is altogether a different and more serious matter,”
      responded the abbé. “The ways of justice are frequently too dark and
      mysterious to be easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the
      matter has been child’s play. If you wish me to enter upon the more
      difficult part of the business, you must assist me by the most minute
      information on every point.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you
      see more clearly into my life than I do myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the first place, then, who examined you,—the king’s
      attorney, his deputy, or a magistrate?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deputy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was he young or old?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “About six or seven and twenty years of age, I should say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So,” answered the abbé. “Old enough to be ambitious,
      but too young to be corrupt. And how did he treat you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With more of mildness than severity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you tell him your whole story?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And did his conduct change at all in the course of your
      examination?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had
      brought me into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By your misfortune?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? the accusation?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; the letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you sure?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I saw it done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater
      scoundrel than you have thought possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word,” said Dantès, “you make me shudder. Is
      the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more
      dangerous than the others.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind; let us go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the
      only proof existing against you.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To M. Noirtier, No. 13 Coq-Héron, Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could
      possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made
      me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring
      me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted
      on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the
      address.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “Noirtier!—I knew a
      person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,—a
      Noirtier, who had been a Girondin during the Revolution! What was your
      deputy called?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “De Villefort!” The abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while
      Dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What ails you?” said he at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you see that ray of sunlight?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to
      you. Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate
      expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this
      Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed?
      Noirtier was his father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its yawning
      gulf before him, he could not have been more completely transfixed with
      horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words. Starting up, he
      clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from
      bursting, and exclaimed, “His father! his father!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, his father,” replied the abbé; “his right name was
      Noirtier de Villefort.” At this instant a bright light shot through
      the mind of Dantès, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure
      before. The change that had come over Villefort during the examination,
      the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost
      supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy
      than to pronounce punishment,—all returned with a stunning force to
      his memory. He cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken
      man, then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to
      his own, and said, “I must be alone, to think over all this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the
      turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and
      contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours
      of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had
      formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a
      solemn oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria, who,
      having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his
      fellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his
      mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbé
      unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter quality
      than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a small
      quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his
      young companion to share the luxuries with him. Dantès followed; his
      features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual expression,
      but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come
      to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his penetrating eye:
      “I regret now,” said he, “having helped you in your late
      inquiries, or having given you the information I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?” inquired Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of
      vengeance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès smiled. “Let us talk of something else,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in
      accordance with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters.
      The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that
      of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and
      important hints as well as sound information; but it was never
      egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.
      Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his
      remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort of
      knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the good
      abbé’s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but,
      like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened
      new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic
      glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an
      intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria
      along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must teach me a small part of what you know,” said
      Dantès, “if only to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well
      believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute
      solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and
      uninformed as myself. If you will only agree to my request, I promise you
      never to mention another word about escaping.” The abbé smiled.
      “Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined
      within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics,
      physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am
      acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely
      require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I
      possess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two years!” exclaimed Dantès; “do you really believe I
      can acquire all these things in so short a time?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to
      learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes
      the one, philosophy the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But cannot one learn philosophy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences
      to truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into
      heaven.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me
      first? I am in a hurry to begin. I want to learn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the
      prisoners sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following
      day. Dantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing
      quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind
      rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally poetical
      feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of
      arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He already
      knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during
      voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two languages he easily
      comprehended the construction of all the others, so that at the end of six
      months he began to speak Spanish, English, and German. In strict
      accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no more of
      escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such
      thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word (on which
      his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in any way to the
      possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by unheeded in one
      rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year Dantès was a new man.
      Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of the relief his society
      afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and
      distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh
      heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, with folded arms,
      begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon. One day he stopped all at
      once, and exclaimed, “Ah, if there were no sentinel!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said
      Dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as
      though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its
      minutest operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I
      loathe the idea of shedding blood.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a
      measure of self-preservation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No matter! I could never agree to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still, you have thought of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you
      not?” asked Dantès eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel
      in the gallery beyond us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with
      an air of determination that made his companion shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!” Dantès
      endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in token of
      disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three months passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young
      man, in reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe,
      and then as readily straightened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a
      last resort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I promise on my honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design
      into execution.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least a year.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And shall we begin at once?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?”
      asked the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after
      all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known.
      Come, let me show you my plan.” The abbé then showed Dantès the
      sketch he had made for their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own
      cell and that of Dantès, with the passage which united them. In this
      passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would
      bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry
      kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the
      flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened
      that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the
      soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged
      by Dantès before he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were
      then to make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let
      themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder
      of cords. Dantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands
      with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to
      succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity
      proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate
      success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity
      that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the
      turnkey’s visits. They had learned to distinguish the almost
      imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their
      dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his coming. The
      fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have
      entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the
      utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria’s or Dantès’
      cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind
      carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain. More
      than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for
      which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still
      continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one
      language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of
      nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden
      the path of glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first
      society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantès,
      thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired,
      as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting
      in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in
      constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding. At the end
      of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation completed
      beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear the
      measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their
      flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that
      auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the
      stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before
      its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by
      propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls
      through which they had worked their way. Dantès was occupied in arranging
      this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond’s
      cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to
      him in a tone indicative of great suffering. Dantès hastened to his
      dungeon, where he found him standing in the middle of the room, pale as
      death, his forehead streaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched
      tightly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gracious heavens!” exclaimed Dantès, “what is the
      matter? what has happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quick! quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what I
      have to say.” Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid
      countenance of Faria, whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded
      by purple circles, while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his
      very hair seemed to stand on end.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?” cried Dantès, letting
      his chisel fall to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with me. I
      am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the
      paroxysm is fast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to
      my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you
      what that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the
      feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the
      purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a
      red-looking fluid. Bring it to me—or rather—no, no!—I
      may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the
      strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the
      attack may last?”
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated
      his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into
      the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then,
      half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s
      chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins
      were filled with ice. “I am about to be seized with a fit of
      catalepsy; when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and
      motionless as though dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other
      hand, the symptoms may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into
      fearful convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my
      cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be
      removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I
      become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not
      before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the
      knife, pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial
      down my throat, and I may perhaps revive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps!” exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Help! help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”
    </p>
    <p>
      So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable
      to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame, his
      eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one side, his
      cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself about, and
      uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès prevented from
      being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The fit lasted two
      hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and paler than
      marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot, he fell
      back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as rigid as a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,
      taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed
      jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously
      awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of
      returning animation. Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he
      administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his hair, continued
      gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length a slight color
      tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the dull, open
      eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer made a
      feeble effort to move.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “He is saved! he is saved!” cried Dantès in a paroxysm of
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident
      anxiety towards the door. Dantès listened, and plainly distinguished the
      approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o’clock;
      but Edmond’s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head.
      The young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing
      the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had scarcely done
      so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual
      on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned in the lock, and
      before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long
      corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose restless anxiety concerning his
      friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him, hurried back to
      the abbé’s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing his head
      against it, was soon beside the sick man’s couch. Faria had now
      fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not expect to see you again,” said he feebly, to
      Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why not?” asked the young man. “Did you fancy
      yourself dying?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight,
      I thought you might have made your escape.” The deep glow of
      indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least,” said the abbé, “I now see how wrong such an
      opinion would have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and
      debilitated by this attack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be of good cheer,” replied Dantès; “your strength will
      return.” And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside
      Faria, and took his hands. The abbé shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The last attack I had,” said he, “lasted but half an
      hour, and after it I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move
      neither my right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows
      that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack
      will either carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” cried Dantès; “you are mistaken—you will
      not die! And your third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will
      find you at liberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this,
      only with a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command
      every requisite assistance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good Edmond,” answered the abbé, “be not deceived.
      The attack which has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of
      a prison. None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, we will wait,—a week, a month, two months, if need be,—and
      meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our
      flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able to
      swim we will go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is
      paralyzed; not for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am
      mistaken.” The young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own
      weight, perfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?” asked the abbé.
      “Depend upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I
      experienced of this malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I
      expected it, for it is a family inheritance; both my father and
      grandfather died of it in a third attack. The physician who prepared for
      me the remedy I have twice successfully taken, was no other than the
      celebrated Cabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès. “And
      as for your poor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my
      shoulders, and swim for both of us.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a
      swimmer, must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before
      he had done fifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by
      vain hopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here
      I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all
      human probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young
      and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you
      back your promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is well,” said Dantès. “Then I shall also remain.”
      Then, rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old
      man’s head, he slowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear
      never to leave you while you live.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled
      young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the
      sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand. “I
      accept. You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested
      devotion. But as I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes
      necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier’s gallery;
      he might, by chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the
      attention of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a
      discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then,
      and set about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no
      assistance; keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here
      tomorrow till after the jailer his visited me. I shall have something of
      the greatest importance to communicate to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it.
      Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task,
      in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards
      his aged friend.

      Chapter 18. The Treasure
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Dantès
      returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he
      found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered
      by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which
      alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper,
      which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of
      a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the
      paper to Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?” he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look at it,” said the abbé with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have looked at it with all possible attention,” said
      Dantès, “and I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of
      Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to
      you, since I have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my
      treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweat started forth on Dantès brow. Until this day and for how long a
      time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had
      brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness. With his instinctive
      delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord,
      and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man
      for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so
      painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental
      alienation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your treasure?” stammered Dantès. Faria smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said he. “You have, indeed, a noble nature,
      Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your
      heart at this moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists,
      Dantès, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes—you.
      No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but
      you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so
      afterwards if you will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” murmured Edmond to himself, “this is a terrible
      relapse! There was only this blow wanting.” Then he said aloud,
      “My dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not
      better repose awhile? Tomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative;
      but today I wish to nurse you carefully. Besides,” he said, “a
      treasure is not a thing we need hurry about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!”
      replied the old man. “Who knows if tomorrow, or the next day after,
      the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes,
      indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which
      would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those
      men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted
      it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But
      now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you,
      young and with a promising future,—now that I think of all that may
      result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any
      delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself
      the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.” Edmond turned
      away his head with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,” continued Faria.
      “My words have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well,
      then, read this paper, which I have never shown to anyone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tomorrow, my dear friend,” said Edmond, desirous of not
      yielding to the old man’s madness. “I thought it was
      understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper
      today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will not irritate him,” thought Edmond, and taking the
      paper, of which half was wanting,—having been burnt, no doubt, by
      some accident,—he read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">      “This treasure, which may amount to two...
      of Roman crowns in the most distant a...
      of the second opening wh...
      declare to belong to him alo...
      heir.
           “25th April, 149’”
 </pre>
    <p>
      “Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines
      and unconnected words, which are rendered illegible by fire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not
      for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and
      have reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first
      listen to the history of this paper.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be
      sure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability,
      glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his
      alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with
      his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid
      discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the
      jailer, had come in person to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he might
      conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him
      with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with pity, might order
      him to be removed to better quarters, and thus separate him from his young
      companion. But fortunately this was not the case, and the governor left
      him, convinced that the poor madman, for whom in his heart he felt a kind
      of affection, was only troubled with a slight indisposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,
      tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first
      acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so
      wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much
      wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as
      to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend,
      thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for
      all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so terrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone
      by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over the
      distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful
      efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg was inert,
      and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was obliged to assist
      him, for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small
      aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.

      “Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a
      benignant smile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in
      vain. Listen to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he
      seated himself on the stool beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and
      intimate friend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I
      owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,
      although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I heard
      the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like
      public rumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my
      paradise. I was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone
      in the world, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him
      all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The
      cardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble
      patron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty
      family manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing
      searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them, he
      looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume relating to the
      History of the City of Rome. There, in the twentieth chapter of the Life
      of Pope Alexander VI., were the following lines, which I can never forget:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The great wars of Romagna had ended; Cæsar Borgia, who had
      completed his conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope
      had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of
      France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it
      was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme,
      which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of
      exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two
      cardinals.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich
      men—<i>this</i> was the return the holy father looked for. In the
      first place, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices
      which the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell
      besides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The pope and Cæsar Borgia first found the two future cardinals;
      they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of
      the Holy See, and Cæsar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman
      nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope. They
      were ambitious, and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their
      appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being
      cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held
      before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered
      into the coffers of the speculators.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The
      pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the
      insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs and
      take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited
      the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute between the holy
      father and his son. Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means
      which he always had ready for his friends, that is to say, in the first
      place, the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request
      that they go and open a designated cupboard. This key was furnished with a
      small iron point,—a negligence on the part of the locksmith. When
      this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard, of which the lock
      was difficult, the person was pricked by this small point, and died next
      day. Then there was the ring with the lion’s head, which Cæsar wore
      when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit
      the hand thus favored, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was
      mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cæsar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the
      cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander
      VI., replied: ‘Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and
      Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we
      shall get that money back. Besides, you forget, Cæsar, an indigestion
      declares itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of
      a day or two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the
      cardinals were consequently invited to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San
      Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by
      report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a good
      appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man, and
      greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest
      promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his
      nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant did
      not find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so
      eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a
      centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, ‘Cæsar wills that
      you die.’ but it was a legate <i>à latere</i>, who came with a smile
      on his lips to say from the pope, ‘His holiness requests you to dine
      with him.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Spada set out about two o’clock to San Pierdarena. The pope
      awaited him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of
      his nephew, in full costume, and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked
      attentions. Spada turned pale, as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical
      air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well
      spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew
      if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly
      comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had
      already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the
      pope’s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach
      him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician
      declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on
      the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making
      signs which his wife could not comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage,
      under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the
      inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had
      written:—‘I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my
      books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg
      he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on
      the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was
      really the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they
      were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was
      all. Cæsar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found
      nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in
      plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say
      to his wife before he expired: ‘Look well among my uncle’s
      papers; there is a will.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done,
      but it was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the
      Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and
      the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were
      beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on.
      Alexander VI. died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake. Cæsar,
      poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but
      the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger’s.
      Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely killed in
      a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After the pope’s death and his son’s exile, it was
      supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had
      held before the cardinal’s time; but this was not the case. The
      Spadas remained in doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair,
      and the public rumor was, that Cæsar, a better politician than his father,
      had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the
      two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was
      completely despoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Up to this point,” said Faria, interrupting the thread of his
      narrative, “this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, my friend,” cried Dantès, “on the contrary, it
      seems as if I were reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled
      on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists;
      some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I come
      now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was—the Count of
      Spada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank
      with his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity. He
      did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained in
      the family, and was in the count’s possession. It had been handed
      down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had
      been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in
      the family with superstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with
      beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant
      always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the sight of papers of all sorts,—titles, contracts,
      parchments, which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending
      from the poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of
      documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but in
      spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found—nothing. Yet I had
      read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the
      sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had
      occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Cæsar Spada; but could only
      trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his
      companion in misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited
      the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the
      treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth
      under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a
      thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for
      three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the
      Count of Spada in his poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers,
      his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary.
      All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had
      in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for
      the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and
      history of his house. All this I did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear
      Edmond, we are near the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the
      death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see
      presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the
      thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a
      stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending
      to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the
      famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and
      overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I
      fell asleep about three o’clock in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in
      utter darkness. I rang for a light, but as no one came, I determined to
      find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners
      which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a
      wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of
      paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light
      from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to
      make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then
      recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table
      beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a
      marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for
      it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring
      flame, set light to it.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire
      ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in
      my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the
      fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion,
      recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in
      mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire;
      nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that
      paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and then I will
      complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantès, who this time
      read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling
      rust:—

    <p>
      “And now,” said the abbé, “read this other paper;”
      and he presented to Dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written
      on it, which Edmond read as follows:—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">           “...ing invited to dine by his Holiness
        ...content with making me pay for my hat,

 </pre>
    <p>
      Faria followed him with an excited look, “and now,” he said,
      when he saw that Dantès had read the last line, “put the two
      fragments together, and judge for yourself.” Dantès obeyed, and the
      conjointed pieces gave the following:—

    <p>
      “Well, do you comprehend now?” inquired Faria.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long
      sought for,” replied Edmond, still incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; a thousand times, yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who completed it as it now is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest;
      measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the
      hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in
      a cavern by the small ray of light above us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant,
      carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian
      kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite
      contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him,
      wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty
      departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused
      their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving
      Piombino.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost
      paternal expression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do
      myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die
      here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no
      more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last
      Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this
      symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your
      mind satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may
      enjoy it without remorse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you say this treasure amounts to”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our
      money.” [*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * $2,600,000 in 1894.
</pre>
    <p>
      “Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible? and why?” asked the old man. “The Spada
      family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth
      century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were
      wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare;
      there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed
      of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and
      which they cannot touch.” Edmond thought he was in a dream—he
      wavered between incredulity and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued
      Faria, “that I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had
      we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to
      Monte Cristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will
      conduct me thither. Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied
      Dantès, “and to you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of
      yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You
      are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God
      has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could
      not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.” And Faria
      extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man
      who threw himself upon his neck and wept.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ow that this
      treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s
      meditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really
      loved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he
      expatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with
      thirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days to
      his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the
      oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected
      how much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions
      could do to his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it, and
      had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between
      Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This island
      was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a rock of
      almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by
      volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dantès drew a
      plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means
      he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dantès was far from being as
      enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that
      Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the
      discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased
      Edmond’s admiration of him; but at the same time Dantès could not
      believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed;
      and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet
      believed it was no longer there.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last
      chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual
      imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side,
      which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it
      completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had
      partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered,
      the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater,
      for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would
      undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a stronger, and more
      inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their
      hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful
      resignation, to Faria, “that God deems it right to take from me any
      claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you. I have promised to
      remain forever with you, and now I could not break my promise if I would.
      The treasure will be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit
      this prison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which
      awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence,
      our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it
      is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages
      you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all
      their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you have
      made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and
      the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them—this
      is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and
      happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of
      gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the
      clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for <i>terra
      firma</i>, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them. To have
      you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,—which
      embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable
      of great and terrible things, if I should ever be free,—so fills my
      whole existence, that the despair to which I was just on the point of
      yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this—this
      is my fortune—not chimerical, but actual. I owe you my real good, my
      present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia
      himself, could not deprive me of this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed
      together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as
      to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied would
      be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and
      had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was continually
      thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and
      anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might be
      some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart; and
      Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed the
      second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be
      able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while
      Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were to
      serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour
      and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was,
      to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some
      pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to
      find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,—the
      appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.
      Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and
      foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had
      gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his
      youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who learns
      to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually employed,—Faria,
      that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for fear of recalling the
      almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant
      light wandering in the night. So life went on for them as it does for
      those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along
      mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young
      man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many
      stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond
      returned to his cell. One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he
      heard someone calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His
      name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name,
      reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.
      Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon. “Alas,”
      murmured Edmond; “can it be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached
      the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the light of the
      wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dantès saw the old
      man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead. His features were
      writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew, and which had
      so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you
      understand, do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed
      towards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!” Faria had just
      sufficient strength to restrain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only
      think of you, my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity
      supportable or your flight possible. It would require years to do again
      what I have done here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our
      jailers knew we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my
      dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;
      some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will
      appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young, strong, and
      enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have
      been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you
      as a drag to all your movements. At length providence has done something
      for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it was time I
      should die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my
      friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,
      which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which
      had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have saved
      you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the foot
      of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red
      liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the
      magic draught. Quick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there
      any fresh instructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head,
      “but no matter; God wills it that man whom he has created, and in
      whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in
      his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is
      yet always so dear.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I
      will save you yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing
      towards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and
      seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five
      minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour
      there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of
      life are now exhausted in me, and death,” he continued, looking at
      his paralyzed arm and leg, “has but half its work to do. If, after
      having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not
      recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I
      can no longer support myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now, my dear friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation
      of my wretched existence,—you whom heaven gave me somewhat late, but
      still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,—at
      the moment of separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness
      and all the prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!”
      The young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old
      man’s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of
      the Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time
      or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes pierce the
      inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much
      riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbé, whom all the world
      called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo—avail yourself of the
      fortune—for you have indeed suffered long enough.” A violent
      convulsion attacked the old man. Dantès raised his head and saw Faria’s
      eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended
      from the chest to the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Adieu, adieu!” murmured the old man, clasping Edmond’s
      hand convulsively—“adieu!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,—no, not yet,” he cried; “do not forsake
      me! Oh, succor him! Help—help—help!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush—hush!” murmured the dying man, “that they
      may not separate us if you save me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides,
      although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you were
      before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not mistake. I suffer less because there is in me less strength
      to endure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth
      to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, ‘tis
      here—‘tis here—‘tis over—my sight is gone—my
      senses fail! Your hand, Dantès! Adieu—adieu!” And raising
      himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his faculties, he
      said,—“Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!” And he
      fell back on the bed. The crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with
      twisted limbs, swollen eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on
      the bed of torture, in place of the intellectual being who so lately
      rested there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed,
      whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the
      distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze he
      awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife,
      pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted
      one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained,
      perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour,
      half an hour,—no change took place. Trembling, his hair erect, his
      brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating of
      his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he put
      the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion to
      force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole of
      the liquid down his throat.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      The draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the
      old man’s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon
      them, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed
      body returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this period
      of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to his heart,
      and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart’s pulsation
      become more and more deep and dull, until at length it stopped; the last
      movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid, the eyes remained
      open, but the eyeballs were glazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six o’clock in the morning, the dawn was just breaking, and
      its feeble ray came into the dungeon, and paled the ineffectual light of
      the lamp. Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man, and
      at times gave it the appearance of life. While the struggle between day
      and night lasted, Dantès still doubted; but as soon as the daylight gained
      the pre-eminence, he saw that he was alone with a corpse. Then an
      invincible and extreme terror seized upon him, and he dared not again
      press the hand that hung out of bed, he dared no longer to gaze on those
      fixed and vacant eyes, which he tried many times to close, but in vain—they
      opened again as soon as shut. He extinguished the lamp, carefully
      concealed it, and then went away, closing as well as he could the entrance
      to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time, for the jailer was coming. On this occasion he began his
      rounds at Dantès’ cell, and on leaving him he went on to Faria’s
      dungeon, taking thither breakfast and some linen. Nothing betokened that
      the man knew anything of what had occurred. He went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going
      on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend. He therefore returned by the
      subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the
      turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys came, and then was heard
      the regular tramp of soldiers. Last of all came the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard the
      voice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead man’s
      face; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner did not
      recover, they sent for the doctor. The governor then went out, and words
      of pity fell on Dantès’ listening ears, mingled with brutal
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well,” said one, “the madman has gone to look
      after his treasure. Good journey to him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his
      shroud!” said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” added a third voice, “the shrouds of the Château d’If
      are not dear!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps,” said one of the previous speakers, “as he was
      a churchman, they may go to some expense in his behalf.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “They may give him the honors of the sack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was said.
      The voices soon ceased, and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the
      cell. Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left some turnkey to
      watch the dead. He remained, therefore, mute and motionless, hardly
      venturing to breathe. At the end of an hour, he heard a faint noise, which
      increased. It was the governor who returned, followed by the doctor and
      other attendants. There was a moment’s silence,—it was evident
      that the doctor was examining the dead body. The inquiries soon commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had
      succumbed, and declared that he was dead. Questions and answers followed
      in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant, for he felt that all
      the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am very sorry for what you tell me,” said the governor,
      replying to the assurance of the doctor, “that the old man is really
      dead; for he was a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and
      required no watching.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” added the turnkey, “there was no occasion for
      watching him: he would have stayed here fifty years, I’ll answer for
      it, without any attempt to escape.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still,” said the governor, “I believe it will be
      requisite, notwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your
      science, but in discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly
      assured that the prisoner is dead.” There was a moment of complete
      silence, during which Dantès, still listening, knew that the doctor was
      examining the corpse a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may make your mind easy,” said the doctor; “he is
      dead. I will answer for that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know, sir,” said the governor, persisting, “that we
      are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination. In
      spite of all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by
      fulfilling the formalities described by law.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let the irons be heated,” said the doctor; “but really
      it is a useless precaution.” This order to heat the irons made
      Dantès shudder. He heard hasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going
      and coming, and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here is the brazier, lighted.” There was a moment’s
      silence, and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the
      peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès
      was listening in horror. The perspiration poured forth upon the young man’s
      brow, and he felt as if he should faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see, sir, he is really dead,” said the doctor; “this
      burn in the heel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and
      delivered from his captivity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wasn’t his name Faria?” inquired one of the officers
      who accompanied the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too,
      very learned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to
      his treasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,” said the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You had never anything to complain of?” said the governor to
      the jailer who had charge of the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never, sir,” replied the jailer, “never; on the
      contrary, he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories. One day,
      too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, ah!” said the doctor, “I did not know that I had a
      rival; but I hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the
      newest sack we can find. Will that satisfy you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?”
      inquired a turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly. But make haste—I cannot stay here all day.”
      Other footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards
      the noise of rustling canvas reached Dantès’ ears, the bed creaked,
      and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor;
      then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This evening,” said the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will there be any mass?” asked one of the attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is impossible,” replied the governor. “The
      chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence,
      in order to take a trip to Hyères for a week. I told him I would attend to
      the prisoners in his absence. If the poor abbé had not been in such a
      hurry, he might have had his requiem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pooh, pooh;” said the doctor, with the impiety usual in
      persons of his profession; “he is a churchman. God will respect his
      profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a
      priest.” A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile
      the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This evening,” said the governor, when the task was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At what hour?” inquired a turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, about ten or eleven o’clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we watch by the corpse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were alive—that
      is all.” Then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the
      distance; the noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts
      ceased, and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,—the
      silence of death, which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the
      very soul of Dantès. Then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his
      head, and looked carefully around the chamber. It was empty, and Dantès
      emerged from the tunnel.

    <h2>
      Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the bed, at full
      length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the
      window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude folds was stretched a
      long and stiffened form; it was Faria’s last winding-sheet,—a
      winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so little. Everything was
      in readiness. A barrier had been placed between Dantès and his old friend.
      No longer could Edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to
      be penetrating the mysteries of death; no longer could he clasp the hand
      which had done so much to make his existence blessed. Faria, the
      beneficent and cheerful companion, with whom he was accustomed to live so
      intimately, no longer breathed. He seated himself on the edge of that
      terrible bed, and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone! he was alone again! again condemned to silence—again face to
      face with nothingness! Alone!—never again to see the face, never
      again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth!
      Was not Faria’s fate the better, after all—to solve the
      problem of life at its source, even at the risk of horrible suffering? The
      idea of suicide, which his friend had driven away and kept away by his
      cheerful presence, now hovered like a phantom over the abbé’s dead
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I could die,” he said, “I should go where he goes,
      and should assuredly find him again. But how to die? It is very easy,”
      he went on with a smile; “I will remain here, rush on the first
      person that opens the door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine
      me.” But excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail
      bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave. Dantès recoiled
      from the idea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to
      an ardent desire for life and liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Die? oh, no,” he exclaimed—“not die now, after
      having lived and suffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years
      ago; but now to die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of
      destiny. No, I want to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet
      win back the happiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must
      not forget that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who
      knows, some friends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I shall
      die in my dungeon like Faria.” As he said this, he became silent and
      gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing
      thought. Suddenly he arose, lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain
      were giddy, paced twice or thrice round the dungeon, and then paused
      abruptly by the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought? Is
      it from thee? Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let
      me take the place of the dead!” Without giving himself time to
      reconsider his decision, and, indeed, that he might not allow his thoughts
      to be distracted from his desperate resolution, he bent over the appalling
      shroud, opened it with the knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse
      from the sack, and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on
      his couch, tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own,
      covered it with his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and
      tried vainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned
      the head towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the
      evening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom;
      entered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to the
      other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung off
      his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas,
      and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in which the
      dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any
      mischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dantès might have waited
      until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the governor
      would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed earlier. In
      that case his last hope would have been destroyed. Now his plans were
      fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If while he was being
      carried out the grave-diggers should discover that they were bearing a
      live instead of a dead body, Dantès did not intend to give them time to
      recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife, he meant to open the
      sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their alarm, escape; if they
      tried to catch him, he would use his knife to better purpose.

    </h5>
    <p>
      If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would allow
      himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the
      grave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have
      worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped that the
      weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it. If he
      was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy, he would be stifled,
      and then—so much the better, all would be over. Dantès had not eaten
      since the preceding evening, but he had not thought of hunger, nor did he
      think of it now. His situation was too precarious to allow him even time
      to reflect on any thought but one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first risk that Dantès ran was, that the jailer, when he brought him
      his supper at seven o’clock, might perceive the change that had been
      made; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or fatigue,
      Dantès had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed his bread
      and soup on the table, and went away without saying a word. This time the
      jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to Dantès, and seeing
      that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus discover all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When seven o’clock came, Dantès’ agony really began. His hand
      placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings, while, with
      the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples. From time to time
      chills ran through his whole body, and clutched his heart in a grasp of
      ice. Then he thought he was going to die. Yet the hours passed on without
      any unusual disturbance, and Dantès knew that he had escaped the first
      peril. It was a good augury. At length, about the hour the governor had
      appointed, footsteps were heard on the stairs. Edmond felt that the moment
      had arrived, summoned up all his courage, held his breath, and would have
      been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of
      his veins. The footsteps—they were double—paused at the door—and
      Dantès guessed that the two grave-diggers had come to seek him—this
      idea was soon converted into certainty, when he heard the noise they made
      in putting down the hand-bier. The door opened, and a dim light reached
      Dantès’ eyes through the coarse sack that covered him; he saw two
      shadows approach his bed, a third remaining at the door with a torch in
      its hand. The two men, approaching the ends of the bed, took the sack by
      its extremities.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He’s heavy though for an old and thin man,” said one,
      as he raised the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,”
      said another, lifting the feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you tied the knot?” inquired the first speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?” was
      the reply, “I can do that when we get there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you’re right,” replied the companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s the knot for?” thought Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      They deposited the supposed corpse on the bier. Edmond stiffened himself
      in order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party, lighted by
      the man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs. Suddenly he
      felt the fresh and sharp night air, and Dantès knew that the mistral was
      blowing. It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely
      mingled. The bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting the
      bier down on the ground. One of them went away, and Dantès heard his shoes
      striking on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where am I?” he asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, he is by no means a light load!” said the other
      bearer, sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow. Dantès’ first
      impulse was to escape, but fortunately he did not attempt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Give us a light,” said the other bearer, “or I shall
      never find what I am looking for.” The man with the torch complied,
      although not asked in the most polite terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What can he be looking for?” thought Edmond. “The
      spade, perhaps.” An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the
      grave-digger had found the object of his search. “Here it is at
      last,” he said, “not without some trouble though.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” was the answer, “but it has lost nothing by
      waiting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy metallic
      substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord was fastened
      round his feet with sudden and painful violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, have you tied the knot?” inquired the grave-digger, who
      was looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,” was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Move on, then.” And the bier was lifted once more, and they
      proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They advanced fifty paces farther, and then stopped to open a door, then
      went forward again. The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on
      which the château is built, reached Dantès’ ear distinctly as they
      went forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bad weather!” observed one of the bearers; “not a
      pleasant night for a dip in the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, yes, the abbé runs a chance of being wet,” said the
      other; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter. Dantès did not
      comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, here we are at last,” said one of them. “A little
      farther—a little farther,” said the other. “You know
      very well that the last was stopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and
      the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They ascended five or six more steps, and then Dantès felt that they took
      him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to and fro.
      “One!” said the grave-diggers, “two! three!” And
      at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded
      bird, falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood curdle.
      Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid
      descent, it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, with a horrible splash, he darted like an arrow into the ice-cold
      water, and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry, stifled in a moment by
      his immersion beneath the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès had been flung into the sea, and was dragged into its depths by a
      thirty-six pound shot tied to his feet. The sea is the cemetery of the
      Château d’If.

    <h2>
      Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>antes, although
      stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence of mind to hold his
      breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was for every chance) held
      his knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack, extricated his arm, and
      then his body; but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the
      shot, he felt it dragging him down still lower. He then bent his body, and
      by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs, at the moment
      when it seemed as if he were actually strangled. With a mighty leap he
      rose to the surface of the sea, while the shot dragged down to the depths
      the sack that had so nearly become his shroud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid being
      seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where he had
      first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the
      wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to
      appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and terrible,
      whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm. Behind
      him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the
      vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to
      seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two
      figures. He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea;
      doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. Dantès dived
      again, and remained a long time beneath the water. This was an easy feat
      to him, for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before
      the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously
      declared to be the best swimmer in the port. When he came up again the
      light had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must now get his bearings. Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest
      islands of all those that surround the Château d’If, but Ratonneau
      and Pomègue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and
      Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès’ venture. The islands
      of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château d’If; Dantès,
      nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his way
      in the darkness of the night? At this moment he saw the light of Planier,
      gleaming in front of him like a star. By leaving this light on the right,
      he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the
      left, therefore, he would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a
      league from the Château d’If to this island. Often in prison Faria
      had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive, “Dantès, you
      must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned if you seek to
      escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for
      exertion.” These words rang in Dantès’ ears, even beneath the
      waves; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not
      lost his strength. He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken
      away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of that element on
      whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantès’ efforts. He listened
      for any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the
      top of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the
      darkness. He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and
      he redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the
      château, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the
      terrible château had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it, but
      he <i>felt</i> its presence. An hour passed, during which Dantès, excited
      by the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves. “Let us
      see,” said he, “I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is
      against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I
      must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?” A shudder
      passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest himself; but
      the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not make use of this
      means of recuperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said he, “I will swim on until I am worn out, or
      the cramp seizes me, and then I shall sink;” and he struck out with
      the energy of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense, and
      heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a
      sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been shot, and
      listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put out his hand,
      and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had
      gained the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so much
      as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion. It
      was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantès rose, advanced a few steps, and, with a
      fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the granite, which
      seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of the wind and rain, he
      fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion. At the expiration of
      an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder. The tempest was let
      loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings; from time to time
      a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent,
      lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès had not been deceived—he had reached the first of the two
      islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen. He knew that it was barren and
      without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to plunge
      into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but larger, and
      consequently better adapted for concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had he
      availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury. Edmond
      felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing
      themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was safely
      sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the
      elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed to him
      that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a vessel at
      anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of the storm. He
      then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty hours.
      He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged
      in a hollow of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights
      of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the Island of
      Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantès saw a
      fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and
      waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching with frightful
      rapidity. Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their
      danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed him four men
      clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung to the
      broken rudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his
      ears by the wind. Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was
      waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared
      in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird. At the same moment a
      violent crash was heard, and cries of distress. Dantès from his rocky
      perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the fragments the floating forms
      of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces;
      he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing—the cries
      had ceased, and the tempest continued to rage. By degrees the wind abated,
      vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament appeared
      studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became visible in the
      horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded their
      foaming crests with gold. It was day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if he
      now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in the
      Château d’If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be
      witnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and
      land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing
      majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o’clock.
      The sea continued to get calmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In two or three hours,” thought Dantès, “the turnkey
      will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek
      for me in vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered;
      the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I
      uttered, will be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will
      pursue the wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse
      shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of
      Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by
      sea. I am cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. O
      my God, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what
      I am unable to do for myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dantès (his eyes turned in the direction of the Château d’If)
      uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pomègue
      a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of
      prey; and with his sailor’s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan.
      She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea
      rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves. “Oh,”
      cried Edmond, “to think that in half an hour I could join her, did I
      not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles! What
      can I do? What story can I invent? under pretext of trading along the
      coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to
      doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot—— I am
      starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted; besides,
      perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress. I can pass as one of the
      sailors wrecked last night. My story will be accepted, for there is no one
      left to contradict me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had
      been wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a
      point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel’s
      keel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant Dantès’ plan
      was formed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the
      timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was
      taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am saved!” murmured he. And this conviction restored his
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking between
      the Château d’If and the tower of Planier. For an instant he feared
      lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea; but he
      soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy, between
      the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne. However, the vessel and the swimmer
      insensibly neared one another, and in one of its tacks the tartan bore
      down within a quarter of a mile of him. He rose on the waves, making signs
      of distress; but no one on board saw him, and the vessel stood on another
      tack. Dantès would have shouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for
      without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the vessel—certainly
      to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had
      yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him. Then he
      advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her course.
      By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, and
      uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This time he was both seen and
      heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At the same time, he
      saw they were about to lower the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards
      him. Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless, and
      swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his
      strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him.
      His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was almost
      breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them
      cried in Italian, “Courage!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to
      surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface, struggled
      with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and
      felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his
      feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky turned gray. A
      convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He felt himself
      seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan.
      His first care was to see what course they were taking. They were rapidly
      leaving the Château d’If behind. Dantès was so exhausted that the
      exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his limbs
      with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who had cried
      out “Courage!” held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while
      the third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with
      that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped
      yesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction of
      his limbs restored their elasticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you?” said the pilot in bad French.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am,” replied Dantès, in bad Italian, “a Maltese
      sailor. We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last
      night overtook us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where do you come from?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our
      captain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and
      fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a
      piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my
      life, and I thank you,” continued Dantès. “I was lost when one
      of your sailors caught hold of my hair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was I,” said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance;
      “and it was time, for you were sinking.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” returned Dantès, holding out his hand, “I thank
      you again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I almost hesitated, though,” replied the sailor; “you
      looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches,
      and your hair a foot long.” Dantès recollected that his hair and
      beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Château d’If.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said he, “I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto
      not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of
      danger; but today the vow expires.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now what are we to do with you?” said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely
      escaped; but I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I
      shall be sure to find employment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know the Mediterranean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have sailed over it since my childhood.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know the best harbors?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage
      over my eyes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say, captain,” said the sailor who had cried “Courage!”
      to Dantès, “if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with
      us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he says true,” said the captain doubtingly. “But in
      his present condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of
      keeping it afterwards.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do more than I promise,” said Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We shall see,” returned the other, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are you going?” asked Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Leghorn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer
      the wind?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You shall pass it by twenty fathoms.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take the helm, and let us see what you know.” The young man
      took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and
      seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she yet was tolerably
      obedient,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the sheets,” said he. The four seamen, who composed the
      crew, obeyed, while the pilot looked on. “Haul taut.”—They
      obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Belay.” This order was also executed; and the vessel passed,
      as Dantès had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo!” said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo!” repeated the sailors. And they all looked with
      astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his
      body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see,” said Dantès, quitting the helm, “I shall be
      of some use to you, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at
      Leghorn, you can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages
      I get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you
      are reasonable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,”
      returned Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s not fair,” said the seaman who had saved Dantès;
      “for you know more than we do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that to you, Jacopo?” returned the Captain. “Everyone
      is free to ask what he pleases.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s true,” replied Jacopo; “I only make a
      remark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of
      trousers, if you have them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Jacopo; “but I have a shirt and a pair of
      trousers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is all I want,” interrupted Dantès. Jacopo dived into
      the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, then, do you wish for anything else?” said the patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for
      I have not eaten or drunk for a long time.” He had not tasted food
      for forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the
      gourd.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Larboard your helm,” cried the captain to the steersman.
      Dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused
      with hand in mid-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hollo! what’s the matter at the Château d’If?”
      said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned
      the summit of the bastion of the Château d’If. At the same moment
      the faint report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is this?” asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they are
      firing the alarm gun,” replied Dantès. The captain glanced at him,
      but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much
      composure, that suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Pretty strong rum! “ said Dantès, wiping his brow with his
      sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At any rate,” murmured he, “if it be, so much the
      better, for I have made a rare acquisition.” Under pretence of being
      fatigued, Dantès asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be
      relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that
      he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dantès could thus keep his eyes on
      Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the day of the month?” asked he of Jacopo, who sat
      down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The 28th of February.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what year?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what year—you ask me in what year?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the young man, “I ask you in what year!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have forgotten then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I got such a fright last night,” replied Dantès, smiling,
      “that I have almost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The year 1829,” returned Jacopo. It was fourteen years, day
      for day, since Dantès’ arrest. He was nineteen when he entered the
      Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he escaped. A sorrowful smile
      passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès, who
      must believe him dead. Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought
      of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity. He
      renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable
      vengeance he had made in his dungeon. This oath was no longer a vain
      menace; for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable
      to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was
      flying before the wind to Leghorn.

    <h2>
      Chapter 22. The Smugglers
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>antes had not been
      a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his
      lot had been cast. Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria,
      the worthy master of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> (the name of the Genoese
      tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that
      large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provençal, and
      this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and
      frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either
      with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the
      coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are
      always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and
      mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence,
      as they have no visible means of support. It is fair to assume that Dantès
      was on board a smuggler.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of
      distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and
      as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of
      wits, he had at first thought that Dantès might be an emissary of these
      industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this
      ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade. But the
      skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely
      reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating
      above the bastion of the Château d’If, and heard the distant report,
      he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one
      whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes
      of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the
      new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also
      disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his
      recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the
      owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to
      “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave
      accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as
      Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle
      as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his
      nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is
      possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing
      but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond
      was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could
      recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He
      had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and
      was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that
      his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he
      remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his
      beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the
      long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance
      of one of Titian’s portraits. At this period it was not the fashion
      to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be
      surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily
      to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was
      completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for
      a hand-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age,
      and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great
      transformation in his appearance. Dantès had entered the Château d’If
      with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the
      early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future
      corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was
      lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which
      betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with
      thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths
      occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his
      complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which
      produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the
      aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had
      acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual
      expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature,
      that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its
      force within itself.

    <p>
      To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of
      a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and
      imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly
      penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse. Moreover,
      from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the
      faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and
      the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself: it was impossible that his
      best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend left—could recognize
      him; he could not recognize himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i>, who was very desirous of retaining
      amongst his crew a man of Edmond’s value, had offered to advance him
      funds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next care
      on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was
      to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor’s suit—a garb, as we
      all know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt,
      and a cap. It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt
      and trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of
      the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before he
      could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with
      thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in
      seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned. Attracted by his
      prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an engagement to
      Dantès; but Dantès, who had his own projects, would not agree for a longer
      time than three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> had a very active crew, very obedient to their
      captain, who lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week
      at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins,
      contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had
      forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn
      free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain
      speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France. They sailed; Edmond
      was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his
      youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison. He left Gorgone on
      his right and La Pianosa on his left, and went towards the country of
      Paoli and Napoleon. The next morning going on deck, as he always did at an
      early hour, the patron found Dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing
      with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun
      tinged with rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo. <i>La Jeune
      Amélie</i> left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on
      for Corsica.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès thought, as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so
      interesting to him, that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an
      hour be at the promised land. But then what could he do without
      instruments to discover his treasure, without arms to defend himself?
      Besides, what would the sailors say? What would the patron think? He must
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Dantès had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen years
      for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six months or
      a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it
      had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches chimerical?—offspring
      of the brain of the poor Abbé Faria, had they not died with him? It is
      true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was singularly circumstantial, and
      Dantès repeated it to himself, from one end to the other, for he had not
      forgotten a word.

    <p>
      Evening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of
      twilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own,
      for he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to
      behold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck. The next morn
      broke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening
      saw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal for
      landing, for a ship’s lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead
      of the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore. Dantès
      noticed that the captain of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> had, as he neared the
      land, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise, can
      throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything
      proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came
      off with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in
      acknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the sea,
      and the five boats worked so well that by two o’clock in the morning
      all the cargo was out of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> and on <i>terra firma</i>.
      The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of <i>La Jeune
      Amélie</i>, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred Tuscan
      livres, or about eighty francs. But the voyage was not ended. They turned
      the bowsprit towards Sardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo,
      which was to replace what had been discharged. The second operation was as
      successful as the first, <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> was in luck. This new
      cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted
      almost entirely of Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the
      excise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of <i>La Jeune
      Amélie</i>. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded;
      Dantès was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left
      shoulder. Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at
      being wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye
      he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering. He
      had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed with
      the great philosopher, “Pain, thou art not an evil.” He had,
      moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether
      from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human
      sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. Dantès was
      on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he wished
      to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom.
      Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing towards him
      raised him up, and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted
      comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither
      was it so wicked as Dantès thought it, since this man, who had nothing to
      expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the
      prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall. Fortunately,
      as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain herbs gathered
      at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women,
      the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo, and offered him
      in return for his attention a share of his prize-money, but Jacopo refused
      it indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first
      bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection.
      But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that Edmond had a
      right to superiority of position—a superiority which Edmond had
      concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness which Edmond
      showed him was enough for the brave seaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with
      security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the
      helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond,
      with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor
      Abbé Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of the
      coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to
      read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and
      where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds. And when Jacopo
      inquired of him, “What is the use of teaching all these things to a
      poor sailor like me?” Edmond replied, “Who knows? You may one
      day be the captain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte, became
      emperor.” We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as
      skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an
      acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the
      Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had
      passed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not once
      had he found an opportunity of landing there. He then formed a resolution.
      As soon as his engagement with the patron of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> ended,
      he would hire a small vessel on his own account—for in his several
      voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres—and under some pretext
      land at the Island of Monte Cristo. Then he would be free to make his
      researches, not perhaps entirely at liberty, for he would be doubtless
      watched by those who accompanied him. But in this world we must risk
      something. Prison had made Edmond prudent, and he was desirous of running
      no risk whatever. But in vain did he rack his imagination; fertile as it
      was, he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without
      companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron, who
      had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him in his
      service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the
      Via del’ Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to
      congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already Dantès
      had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing all these
      hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred
      leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might not that man
      attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and
      diverging minds. This time it was a great matter that was under
      discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets, stuffs of
      the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find some neutral ground on
      which an exchange could be made, and then to try and land these goods on
      the coast of France. If the venture was successful the profit would be
      enormous, there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the
      crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patron of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> proposed as a place of landing the
      Island of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having
      neither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the
      midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the
      god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times
      have separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have
      included in the same category. At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès
      started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn around
      the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were jumbled
      in a <i>lingua franca</i>. When he again joined the two persons who had
      been discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch at
      Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted,
      was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that
      great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly. Nothing then was
      altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night,
      and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the
      following day.

    <h2>
      Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hus, at length, by
      one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who
      have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny, Dantès was about
      to secure the opportunity he wished for, by simple and natural means, and
      land on the island without incurring any suspicion. One night more and he
      would be on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions
      good and evil passed through Dantès’ mind. If he closed his eyes, he
      saw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in characters of
      flame—if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain.
      He ascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and
      the roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as
      subterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed, wonderstruck,
      filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight,
      when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles. He
      then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had suddenly
      receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the entrance
      vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious
      word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian
      fisherman. All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had again
      reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had been,
      but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was then
      enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in
      his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for departure, and
      these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation. He had by
      degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like
      a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear, distinct, and
      easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the
      superiority of Dantès over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man
      his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that he
      might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At seven o’clock
      in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they doubled
      the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The sea was calm, and, with
      a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a bright blue sky,
      in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights, each of which is a
      world. Dantès told them that all hands might turn in, and he would take
      the helm. When the Maltese (for so they called Dantès) had said this, it
      was sufficient, and all went to their bunks contentedly. This frequently
      happened. Dantès, cast from solitude into the world, frequently
      experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what solitude is more
      complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship floating in isolation on
      the sea during the obscurity of the night, in the silence of immensity,
      and under the eye of heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up by
      his illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations. When the
      patron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and every
      sail full with the breeze. They were making nearly ten knots an hour. The
      Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon. Edmond resigned the
      lugger to the master’s care, and went and lay down in his hammock;
      but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his eyes for a
      moment. Two hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to
      double the Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond
      the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo
      reddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. Dantès
      ordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa to
      starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three
      knots. About five o’clock in the evening the island was distinct,
      and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness of
      the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its
      setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the
      variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue;
      and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist
      passed over his eyes. Never did a gamester, whose whole fortune is staked
      on one cast of the die, experience the anguish which Edmond felt in his
      paroxysms of hope. Night came, and at ten o’clock they anchored. <i>La
      Jeune Amélie</i> was first at the rendezvous. In spite of his usual
      command over himself, Dantès could not restrain his impetuosity. He was
      the first to jump on shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius
      Brutus, have “kissed his mother earth.” It was dark, but at
      eleven o’clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every
      wave she silvered, and then, “ascending high,” played in
      floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island was familiar to the crew of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i>,—it
      was one of her regular haunts. As to Dantès, he had passed it on his
      voyage to and from the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned
      Jacopo. “Where shall we pass the night?” he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, on board the tartan,” replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Should we not do better in the grottos?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What grottos?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, the grottos—caves of the island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know of any grottos,” replied Jacopo. The cold sweat
      sprang forth on Dantès’ brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “None.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Dantès was speechless; then he remembered that these caves
      might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the
      sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to
      discover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and
      Dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides, a
      signal made half a league out at sea, and to which <i>La Jeune Amélie</i>
      replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had
      come. The boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all
      was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast
      anchor within a cable’s length of shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the landing began. Dantès reflected, as he worked, on the shout of
      joy which, with a single word, he could evoke from all these men, if he
      gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart; but,
      far from disclosing this precious secret, he almost feared that he had
      already said too much, and by his restlessness and continual questions,
      his minute observations and evident preoccupation, aroused suspicions.
      Fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his painful past gave
      to his countenance an indelible sadness, and the glimmerings of gayety
      seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day, taking a
      fowling-piece, powder, and shot, Dantès declared his intention to go and
      kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock,
      his wish was construed into a love of sport, or a desire for solitude.
      However, Jacopo insisted on following him, and Dantès did not oppose this,
      fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust. Scarcely, however, had
      they gone a quarter of a league when, having killed a kid, he begged
      Jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request them to cook it, and when
      ready to let him know by firing a gun. This and some dried fruits and a
      flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill of fare. Dantès went on, looking
      from time to time behind and around about him. Having reached the summit
      of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath him, his companions, whom
      Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy preparing the repast which
      Edmond’s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man
      superior to his fellows. “In two hours’ time,” said he,
      “these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each, to go and
      risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more; then they will
      return with a fortune of six hundred francs, and waste this treasure in
      some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs. At this
      moment hope makes me despise their riches, which seem to me contemptible.
      Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me, that I shall, on
      compulsion, consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost
      happiness. Oh, no!” exclaimed Edmond, “that will not be. The
      wise, unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one thing. Besides, it
      were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life.”
      Thus Dantès, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now
      not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was not in Dantès,
      but in providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has filled him
      with boundless desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn by
      a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never
      before trod, Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must
      have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest object
      with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain rocks, marks
      made by the hand of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as it
      invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have
      respected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree of
      regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the marks
      were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes laden
      with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to separate
      the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were.
      The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes. Might it not have been
      the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in order that they might
      serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe, which he
      could not foresee would have been so complete. This solitary place was
      precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying
      treasure. Only, might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes
      than those for whom they were made? and had the dark and wondrous island
      indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?

    </h5>
    <p>
      It seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the
      inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks
      ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock, placed
      solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to lead.
      Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the
      route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned round
      and retraced his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from a
      spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at the
      moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they saw
      Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock, and
      they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed his
      direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they watched his
      daring progress, Edmond’s foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on
      the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards him, for all
      loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo reached him first.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had rolled
      down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet. They poured a little rum down
      his throat, and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him,
      produced the same effect as formerly. Edmond opened his eyes, complained
      of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his head, and severe
      pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to the shore; but when they
      touched him, although under Jacopo’s directions, he declared, with
      heavy groans, that he could not bear to be moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner, but he
      insisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should
      have their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a
      little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The sailors
      did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of the
      roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious. An
      hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been able to do was to
      drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown
      rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, instead of growing easier, Dantès’ pains appeared to increase
      in violence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in
      order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France, between
      Nice and Fréjus, urged Dantès to try and rise. Edmond made great exertions
      in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning and turning
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has broken his ribs,” said the commander, in a low voice.
      “No matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We
      will try and carry him on board the tartan.” Dantès declared,
      however, that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony
      which the slightest movement cost him. “Well,” said the
      patron, “let what may happen, it shall never be said that we
      deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening.” This
      very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it. The patron
      was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up
      an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. Dantès would not allow that
      any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his
      favor. “No, no,” he said to the patron, “I was awkward,
      and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small
      supply of biscuit, a gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend
      myself at need, and a pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in
      coming back for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you’ll die of hunger,” said the patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would rather do so,” was Edmond reply, “than suffer
      the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.”
      The patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in
      the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when
      her toilet should be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are we to do, Maltese?” asked the captain. “We
      cannot leave you here so, and yet we cannot stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, go!” exclaimed Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We shall be absent at least a week,” said the patron, “and
      then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” said Dantès, “if in two or three days you hail
      any fishing-boat, desire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five
      piastres for my passage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one,
      return for me.” The patron shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen, Captain Baldi; there’s one way of settling this,”
      said Jacopo. “Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the
      wounded man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And give up your share of the venture,” said Edmond, “to
      remain with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Jacopo, “and without any hesitation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,” replied
      Edmond, “and heaven will recompense you for your generous
      intentions; but I do not wish anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest
      will set me up, and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most
      excellent for bruises.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s
      hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and
      remain alone. The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set
      sail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making
      signs of a cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only,
      as if he could not move the rest of his body. Then, when they had
      disappeared, he said with a smile,—“‘Tis strange that it
      should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion.”
      Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock, from which he had
      a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan complete her
      preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing herself as
      gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set sail. At the end
      of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was impossible
      for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was. Then
      Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs
      of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand, his pickaxe in the other,
      and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated.
      “And now,” he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian
      fisherman, which Faria had related to him, “now, open sesame!”

      Chapter 24. The Secret Cave
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sun had nearly
      reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks, which
      seemed themselves sensible of the heat. Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden
      in the bushes, chirped with a monotonous and dull note; the leaves of the
      myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind. At every step that
      Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the
      emerald; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a
      word, the island was inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by
      the hand of God. He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that
      dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are
      watched and observed. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when
      Edmond was about to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe,
      seized his gun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence
      gazed round in every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could
      distinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its historical
      associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the
      experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the proud,
      and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the brigantine that
      had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just set sail, that
      Edmond fixed his eyes. The first was just disappearing in the straits of
      Bonifacio; the other, following an opposite direction, was about to round
      the Island of Corsica. This sight reassured him. He then looked at the
      objects near him. He saw that he was on the highest point of the island,—a
      statue on this vast pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight,
      while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it
      with a fringe of foam. Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for
      he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned
      should happen in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he had
      noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the bath of
      some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth, and
      deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the
      lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbé Faria, had been so
      skilfully used to guide him through the Dædalian labyrinth of
      probabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be
      watched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed the
      line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had buried
      his treasure. It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the
      circular rock. One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his theory.
      How could this rock, which weighed several tons, have been lifted to this
      spot, without the aid of many men? Suddenly an idea flashed across his
      mind. Instead of raising it, thought he, they have lowered it. And he
      sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly
      stood. He soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had
      slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied. A large
      stone had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around
      it, so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered
      with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the
      stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to the
      earth.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Dantès dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he detected,
      the ingenious artifice. He attacked this wall, cemented by the hand of
      time, with his pickaxe. After ten minutes’ labor the wall gave way,
      and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened. Dantès went and cut
      the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped off its branches,
      inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But the rock was too
      heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone man, were he Hercules
      himself. Dantès saw that he must attack the wedge. But how? He cast his
      eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had
      left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would serve him for this
      purpose. With the aid of his pickaxe, Dantès, after the manner of a
      labor-saving pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that
      supported it, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his
      handkerchief in saltpetre. He lighted it and retired. The explosion soon
      followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of
      the powder; the lower one flew into pieces; thousands of insects escaped
      from the aperture Dantès had previously formed, and a huge snake, like the
      guardian demon of the treasure, rolled himself along in darkening coils,
      and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès approached the upper rock, which now, without any support, leaned
      towards the sea. The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it, and,
      selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack,
      placed his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every nerve to move
      the mass. The rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered on its base.
      Dantès redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient Titans,
      who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods. The
      rock yielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally
      disappeared in the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring
      let into a square flag-stone. Dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise;
      never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success. He would
      fain have continued, but his knees trembled, and his heart beat so
      violently, and his sight became so dim, that he was forced to pause. This
      feeling lasted but for a moment. Edmond inserted his lever in the ring and
      exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and disclosed steps that
      descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto.
      Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy. Dantès turned pale,
      hesitated, and reflected. “Come,” said he to himself, “be
      a man. I am accustomed to adversity. I must not be cast down by the
      discovery that I have been deceived. What, then, would be the use of all I
      have suffered? The heart breaks when, after having been elated by
      flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions destroyed. Faria has dreamed
      this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came
      here, or if he did, Cæsar Borgia, the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy
      and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered his traces,
      pursued them as I have done, raised the stone, and descending before me,
      has left me nothing.” He remained motionless and pensive, his eyes
      fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the
      slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of
      curiosity.” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career
      of that royal bandit. This fabulous event formed but a link in a long
      chain of marvels. Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword
      in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps
      two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as I
      am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring
      progress.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?”
      asked Dantès of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fate,” replied he, smiling, “of those who buried
      Alaric.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yet, had he come,” thought Dantès, “he would have found
      the treasure, and Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he
      could devour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in
      replacing this rock. I will go down.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of
      human philosophy, “Perhaps!” But instead of the darkness, and
      the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find, Dantès saw a
      dim and bluish light, which, as well as the air, entered, not merely by
      the aperture he had just formed, but by the interstices and crevices of
      the rock which were visible from without, and through which he could
      distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks,
      and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks. After having
      stood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which was rather warm
      than damp, Dantès’ eye, habituated as it was to darkness, could
      pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which was of granite
      that sparkled like diamonds. “Alas,” said Edmond, smiling,
      “these are the treasures the cardinal has left; and the good abbé,
      seeing in a dream these glittering walls, has indulged in fallacious
      hopes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But he called to mind the words of the will, which he knew by heart.
      “In the farthest angle of the second opening,” said the
      cardinal’s will. He had only found the first grotto; he had now to
      seek the second. Dantès continued his search. He reflected that this
      second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the
      stones, and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening
      existed, masked for precaution’s sake. The pickaxe struck for a
      moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès’ forehead large
      drops of perspiration. At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall
      gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with
      the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that
      there, in all probability, the opening must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to
      avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe,
      struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that
      appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the
      consoling sound he had before heard. He again struck it, and with greater
      force. Then a singular thing occurred. As he struck the wall, pieces of
      stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off,
      and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone. The
      aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then this stucco had
      been applied, and painted to imitate granite. Dantès struck with the sharp
      end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between the interstices. It was
      there he must dig. But by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as
      the proofs that Faria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his
      heart give way, and a feeling of discouragement stole over him. This last
      proof, instead of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the
      pickaxe descended, or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his
      hand over his brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an
      excuse, a desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in
      reality because he felt that he was about to faint. The island was
      deserted, and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance; afar off,
      a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a moment;
      he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the cavern. The
      pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his grasp; he
      seized it, and attacked the wall. After several blows he perceived that
      the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed one upon the
      other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe, and
      using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on
      hinges, and fall at his feet. He had nothing more to do now, but with the
      iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one. The
      aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting,
      he could still cling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. At
      last, after renewed hesitation, Dantès entered the second grotto. The
      second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could
      only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was
      surprised not to find in the outer cavern. He waited in order to allow
      pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on. At the left of
      the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to Dantès’ eye there was
      no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first,
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at
      length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be
      decided. He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution,
      attacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth blow the
      pickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral knell, never
      did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. Had Dantès found
      nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale. He again struck his
      pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the
      same sound. “It is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought
      he. At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dantès
      seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair. A wild
      goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a little
      distance. This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner;
      but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the
      fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended
      with this torch. He wished to see everything. He approached the hole he
      had dug, and now, with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in
      reality struck against iron and wood. He planted his torch in the ground
      and resumed his labor. In an instant a space three feet long by two feet
      broad was cleared, and Dantès could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut
      steel; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which
      was still untarnished, the arms of the Spada family—viz., a sword,
      <i>en pale</i>, on an oval shield, like all the Italian armorial bearings,
      and surmounted by a cardinal’s hat; Dantès easily recognized them,
      Faria had so often drawn them for him. There was no longer any doubt: the
      treasure was there—no one would have been at such pains to conceal
      an empty casket. In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away, and he
      saw successively the lock, placed between two padlocks, and the two
      handles at each end, all carved as things were carved at that epoch, when
      art rendered the commonest metals precious. Dantès seized the handles, and
      strove to lift the coffer; it was impossible. He sought to open it; lock
      and padlock were fastened; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to
      surrender their trust. Dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe
      between the coffer and the lid, and pressing with all his force on the
      handle, burst open the fastenings. The hinges yielded in their turn and
      fell, still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest
      was open.

    <p>
      Edmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside him.
      He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the
      resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in
      the firmament; then he re-opened them, and stood motionless with
      amazement. Three compartments divided the coffer. In the first, blazed
      piles of golden coin; in the second, were ranged bars of unpolished gold,
      which possessed nothing attractive save their value; in the third, Edmond
      grasped handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which, as they fell on
      one another, sounded like hail against glass. After having touched, felt,
      examined these treasures, Edmond rushed through the caverns like a man
      seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock, from whence he could behold the
      sea. He was alone—alone with these countless, these unheard-of
      treasures! was he awake, or was it but a dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      He would fain have gazed upon his gold, and yet he had not strength
      enough; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent
      his senses from leaving him, and then rushed madly about the rocks of
      Monte Cristo, terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with his
      wild cries and gestures; then he returned, and, still unable to believe
      the evidence of his senses, rushed into the grotto, and found himself
      before this mine of gold and jewels. This time he fell on his knees, and,
      clasping his hands convulsively, uttered a prayer intelligible to God
      alone. He soon became calmer and more happy, for only now did he begin to
      realize his felicity. He then set himself to work to count his fortune.
      There were a thousand ingots of gold, each weighing from two to three
      pounds; then he piled up twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about
      eighty francs of our money, and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI. and
      his predecessors; and he saw that the complement was not half empty. And
      he measured ten double handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many
      of which, mounted by the most famous workmen, were valuable beyond their
      intrinsic worth. Dantès saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to
      be surprised in the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand. A piece of
      biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a
      few hours’ sleep, lying over the mouth of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendous emotions
      had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime.

    <h2>
      Chapter 25. The Unknown
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ay, for which
      Dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes, again dawned.
      With the first light Dantès resumed his search. Again he climbed the rocky
      height he had ascended the previous evening, and strained his view to
      catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but it wore the same wild,
      barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done
      when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve. Descending into the grotto, he
      lifted the stone, filled his pockets with gems, put the box together as
      well and securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from
      which it had been taken, and then carefully trod down the earth to give it
      everywhere a uniform appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced
      the stone, heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of
      crumbling granite, filling the interstices with earth, into which he
      deftly inserted rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and
      flowering thorn, then carefully watering these new plantations, he
      scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the
      cavern as savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he
      impatiently awaited the return of his companions. To wait at Monte Cristo
      for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable
      riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings
      of his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among mankind, and to
      assume the rank, power, and influence which are always accorded to wealth—that
      first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth day, the smugglers returned. From a distance Dantès
      recognized the rig and handling of <i>La Jeune Amélie</i>, and dragging
      himself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his
      companions with an assurance that, although considerably better than when
      they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late accident. He
      then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this question the
      smugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in
      safety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a
      guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail
      towards them. This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade
      the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dantès, whose
      superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so
      materially. In fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when,
      fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the Cape of
      Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit. Upon the whole, however, the
      trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while the
      crew, and particularly Jacopo, expressed great regrets that Dantès had not
      been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits, which amounted to no
      less a sum than fifty piastres each.

    <p>
      Edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the
      faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the
      benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island; but as
      <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him away,
      he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to Leghorn.
      Arrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer in
      precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for
      five thousand francs each. Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in
      the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion; but the
      cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by
      which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day Dantès presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel,
      accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he might
      provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit,
      upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the purpose of
      inquiring after an old man named Louis Dantès, residing in the Allées de
      Meillan, and also a young woman called Mercédès, an inhabitant of the
      Catalan village. Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving
      this magnificent present, which Dantès hastened to account for by saying
      that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his
      family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that
      on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune,
      left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of
      Dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it
      never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy. The term for which
      Edmond had engaged to serve on board <i>La Jeune Amélie</i> having
      expired, Dantès took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his
      powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but
      having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him
      further. The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with
      directions from Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dantès proceeded to make his
      final adieus on board <i>La Jeune Amélie</i>, distributing so liberal a
      gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and
      expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the captain
      he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans.
      Then Dantès departed for Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay;
      this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard
      that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the
      Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of
      possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the
      Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs. Dantès,
      struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel, applied to its
      owner to transfer it to him, offering sixty thousand francs, upon
      condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession. The
      proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more so as the person for
      whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through Switzerland, and
      was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month, by which time
      the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another. A bargain was
      therefore struck. Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a
      Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor, and
      upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty
      thousand francs in bright gold pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable
      crew for the little vessel, but this Dantès declined with many thanks,
      saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal
      pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the
      builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet
      in the cabin at his bed’s head, the closet to contain three
      divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself. The
      builder cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these
      secret places completed by the next day, Dantès furnishing the dimensions
      and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Two hours afterward Dantès sailed from the port of Genoa, under the
      inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich
      Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht. But their wonder
      was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which
      Dantès handled the helm. The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated with
      almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest touch;
      and Dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to
      acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high
      reputation in the art of shipbuilding. The spectators followed the little
      vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible; they then turned
      their conjectures upon her probable destination. Some insisted she was
      making for Corsica, others the Island of Elba; bets were offered to any
      amount that she was bound for Spain; while Africa was positively reported
      by many persons as her intended course; but no one thought of Monte
      Cristo. Yet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel, and at Monte
      Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had proved
      herself a first-class sailor, and had come the distance from Genoa in
      thirty-five hours. Dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of
      the shore, and, instead of landing at the usual place, he dropped anchor
      in the little creek. The island was utterly deserted, and bore no evidence
      of having been visited since he went away; his treasure was just as he had
      left it. Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his
      riches, and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely
      deposited in the compartments of the secret locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed by. Dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the
      island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for
      some important service, till at the end of that time he was perfectly
      conversant with its good and bad qualities. The former Dantès proposed to
      augment, the latter to remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail
      approaching Monte Cristo. As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat he
      had given to Jacopo. He immediately signalled it. His signal was returned,
      and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor beside the yacht.
      A mournful answer awaited each of Edmond’s eager inquiries as to the
      information Jacopo had obtained. Old Dantès was dead, and Mercédès had
      disappeared. Dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward
      calmness; but, leaping lightly ashore, he signified his desire to be quite
      alone. In a couple of hours he returned. Two of the men from Jacopo’s
      boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it, and he gave
      orders that she should be steered direct to Marseilles. For his father’s
      death he was in some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for
      the mysterious disappearance of Mercédès.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without divulging his secret, Dantès could not give sufficiently clear
      instructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was
      desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could
      investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had
      assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of
      recognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he
      thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little
      fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly
      opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his
      departure for the Château d’If, he had been put on board the boat
      destined to convey him thither. Still Dantès could not view without a
      shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to
      demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold
      communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had
      acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an
      English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a
      standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed
      that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.

    </h5>
    <p>
      The first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on the
      Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the <i>Pharaon</i>. Edmond
      welcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own
      sailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which
      time had worked in his own appearance. Going straight towards him, he
      propounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully
      watching the man’s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look
      implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the
      person with whom he was then conversing. Giving the sailor a piece of
      money in return for his civility, Dantès proceeded onwards; but ere he had
      gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop. Dantès
      instantly turned to meet him. “I beg your pardon, sir,” said
      the honest fellow, in almost breathless haste, “but I believe you
      made a mistake; you intended to give me a two-franc piece, and see, you
      gave me a double Napoleon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you, my good friend. I see that I have made a trifling
      mistake, as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you
      another double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to
      ask your messmates to join you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to
      thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in
      speechless astonishment. “Some nabob from India,” was his
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dantès, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his heart
      with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections were there;
      not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled with dear and
      cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the
      end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of the Allées de
      Meillan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond and filial
      remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees tottered under
      him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung for support to
      one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been
      crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there. Recovering
      himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his brows, and stopped
      not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his
      father had lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to train
      before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the house.
      Leaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper
      stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and
      asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the
      negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the
      fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the <i>concierge</i>
      that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to
      the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been
      scarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily. Nothing
      in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been
      in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different, while the
      articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in
      Edmond’s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as
      he had left them. The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as
      the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in
      spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in
      tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last,
      vainly calling for his son. The young couple gazed with astonishment at
      the sight of their visitor’s emotion, and wondered to see the large
      tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable
      features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained
      from questioning him as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy,
      they left him to indulge his sorrow alone.

    </h5>
    <p>
      When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both
      accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come
      again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling would
      ever be open to him. As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he
      paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he
      received, for reply, that the person in question had got into
      difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from
      Bellegarde to Beaucaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the Allées
      de Meillan belonged, Dantès next proceeded thither, and, under the name of
      Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his passport), purchased the
      small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs, at least ten
      thousand more than it was worth; but had its owner asked half a million,
      it would unhesitatingly have been given. The very same day the occupants
      of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house, now become the property
      of Dantès, were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary
      transfer of deeds, etc., that the new landlord gave them their choice of
      any of the rooms in the house, without the least augmentation of rent,
      upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small
      chambers they at present inhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood
      of the Allées de Meillan, and a multitude of theories were afloat, none of
      which was anywhere near the truth. But what raised public astonishment to
      a climax, and set all conjecture at defiance, was the knowledge that the
      same stranger who had in the morning visited the Allées de Meillan had
      been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the Catalans,
      and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman’s hut, and to pass
      more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or
      gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years. But on the following day
      the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a
      handsome present, consisting of an entirely new fishing-boat, with two
      seines and a tender. The delighted recipients of these munificent gifts
      would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor,
      but they had seen him, upon quitting the hut, merely give some orders to a
      sailor, and then springing lightly on horseback, leave Marseilles by the
      Porte d’Aix.

      Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>uch of my readers
      as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance
      have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village
      of Bellegarde,—a little nearer to the former than to the latter,—a
      small roadside inn, from the front of which hung, creaking and flapping in
      the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the
      Pont du Gard. This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand
      side of the post road, and backed upon the Rhône. It also boasted of what
      in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on
      the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of
      guests. A few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for
      existence, but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal
      was the conflict. Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of
      garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a
      forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the
      corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and
      fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid
      ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no
      doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the
      country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those
      parched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a
      grasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with
      its strident, monotonous note.

    <p>
      For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man
      and his wife, with two servants,—a chambermaid named Trinette, and a
      hostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all the
      requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had
      revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the
      stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this
      prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter ruin
      it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhône from which it
      had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred steps from
      the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful description.
    </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age,
      tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those
      southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked
      nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like his
      beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in spite of
      his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads. His
      naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from
      the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from
      morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for guests
      who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the
      meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head
      than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the Spanish
      muleteers. This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle,
      was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the neighborhood of Arles,
      she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but that
      beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the
      slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the
      marshes of Camargue. She remained nearly always in her second-floor
      chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeble on her
      bed, while her husband kept his daily watch at the door—a duty he
      performed with so much the greater willingness, as it saved him the
      necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate,
      who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against
      fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply,
      in these philosophic words:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush, La Carconte. It is God’s pleasure that things should be
      so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from
      the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated between
      Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that
      part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some
      particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on her
      the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of
      Madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would not
      have enabled him to pronounce. Still, let it not be supposed that amid
      this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the unfortunate
      innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful
      canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of
      his peevish partner’s murmurs and lamentations.

    <p>
      Like other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and
      moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to
      display. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place
      without himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the
      picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the
      south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by
      the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming
      fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed
      equally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces,
      parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked
      stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all
      disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his
      pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and
      vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious
      discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the
      joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still
      clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the
      door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass—on
      which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly, endeavoring to
      turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate—to the deserted
      road, which led away to the north and south, when he was aroused by the
      shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he went, he mounted
      to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the entrance door wide
      open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door,
      the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as
      a desert at midday. There it lay stretching out into one interminable line
      of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees,
      altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his
      senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate his
      hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a formidable
      Sahara. Nevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes
      longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from
      the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would
      easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom
      the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist. The horse
      was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy pace. His rider was a
      priest, dressed in black, and wearing a three-cornered hat; and, spite of
      the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the pair came on with a fair degree of
      rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether for
      his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say.
      However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his steed by
      the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him. Availing
      himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen door, he tied the
      animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief, from his pocket,
      wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow, then, advancing
      to the door, struck thrice with the end of his iron-shod stick. At this
      unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant
      of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his sharp white
      teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was
      accustomed to society. At that moment a heavy footstep was heard
      descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with
      many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard besought his
      guest to enter.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “You are welcome, sir, most welcome!” repeated the astonished
      Caderousse. “Now, then, Margotin,” cried he, speaking to the
      dog, “will you be quiet? Pray don’t heed him, sir!—he
      only barks, he never bites. I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be
      acceptable this dreadfully hot day.” Then perceiving for the first
      time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily
      exclaimed: “A thousand pardons! I really did not observe whom I had
      the honor to receive under my poor roof. What would the abbé please to
      have? What refreshment can I offer? All I have is at his service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching
      gaze—there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar
      scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the countenance
      of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of
      attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed it as well to
      terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking with a strong
      Italian accent, “You are, I presume, M. Caderousse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” answered the host, even more surprised at the
      question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it; “I
      am Gaspard Caderousse, at your service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gaspard Caderousse,” rejoined the priest. “Yes,—Christian
      and surname are the same. You formerly lived, I believe in the Allées de
      Meillan, on the fourth floor?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you followed the business of a tailor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off. It is so hot at
      Marseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in
      time go without any clothing whatever. But talking of heat, is there
      nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your
      permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you please, sir,” said Caderousse, who, anxious not to
      lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few
      bottles of Cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a
      trap-door in the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as
      parlor and kitchen. Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at
      the expiration of five minutes, he found the abbé seated upon a wooden
      stool, leaning his elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity
      seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments,
      had crept up to him, and had established himself very comfortably between
      his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was
      fixed earnestly on the traveller’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you quite alone?” inquired the guest, as Caderousse
      placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quite, quite alone,” replied the man—“or, at
      least, practically so, for my poor wife, who is the only person in the
      house besides myself, is laid up with illness, and unable to render me the
      least assistance, poor thing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are married, then?” said the priest, with a show of
      interest, glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, sir,” said Caderousse with a sigh, “it is easy to
      perceive I am not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the
      better for being honest.” The abbé fixed on him a searching,
      penetrating glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, honest—I can certainly say that much for myself,”
      continued the innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé’s
      gaze; “I can boast with truth of being an honest man; and,”
      continued he significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his
      head, “that is more than everyone can say nowadays.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,” said
      the abbé; “for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good
      will be rewarded, and the wicked punished.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Such words as those belong to your profession,” answered
      Caderousse, “and you do well to repeat them; but,” added he,
      with a bitter expression of countenance, “one is free to believe
      them or not, as one pleases.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are wrong to speak thus,” said the abbé; “and
      perhaps I may, in my own person, be able to prove to you how completely
      you are in error.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What mean you?” inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the first place, I must be satisfied that you are the person I
      am in search of.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What proofs do you require?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor
      named Dantès?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dantès? Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dantès and myself
      were intimate friends!” exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance
      flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him,
      while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish
      scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man
      concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Said to bear the name!” repeated Caderousse, becoming excited
      and eager. “Why, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the
      appellation of Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of
      poor Edmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he
      prosperous and happy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the
      felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who
      turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with
      the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor fellow, poor fellow!” murmured Caderousse. “Well,
      there, sir, is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this
      earth, and that none but the wicked prosper. Ah,” continued
      Caderousse, speaking in the highly colored language of the south, “the
      world grows worse and worse. Why does not God, if he really hates the
      wicked, as he is said to do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume
      them altogether?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès,”
      observed the abbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s
      vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I
      confess, I envied him his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear
      to you, by everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and
      sincerely lamented his unhappy fate.” There was a brief silence,
      during which the fixed, searching eye of the abbé was employed in
      scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You knew the poor lad, then?” continued Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer
      to him the consolations of religion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And of what did he die?” asked Caderousse in a choking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when
      they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of
      imprisonment?” Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration
      that gathered on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé,
      “that Dantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified
      Redeemer, that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      “And so he was,” murmured Caderousse. “How should he
      have been otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery
      he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any
      foul spot or stain have fallen on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to
      rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was
      rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been
      his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the
      second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this
      jewel he bestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of
      his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had
      nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.
      Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who
      might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dantès
      carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he
      might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have
      quite sufficed to make his fortune.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing
      looks, “that it was a stone of immense value?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé. “To
      one in Edmond’s position the diamond certainly was of great value.
      It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bless me!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand
      francs! Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as
      that; but you shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest’s
      garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure.
      Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black
      shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of
      Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable
      workmanship. “And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost
      breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand
      francs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied
      the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its
      brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated
      innkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how comes the diamond in your possession, sir? Did Edmond make
      you his heir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, merely his testamentary executor. ‘I once possessed four
      dear and faithful friends, besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed’
      he said; ‘and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved
      over my loss. The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse.’”
      The innkeeper shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Another of the number,’” continued the abbé,
      without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse, “‘is
      called Danglars; and the third, in spite of being my rival, entertained a
      very sincere affection for me.’” A fiendish smile played over
      the features of Caderousse, who was about to break in upon the abbé’s
      speech, when the latter, waving his hand, said, “Allow me to finish
      first, and then if you have any observations to make, you can do so
      afterwards. ‘The third of my friends, although my rival, was much
      attached to me,—his name was Fernand; that of my betrothed was’—Stay,
      stay,” continued the abbé, “I have forgotten what he called
      her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercédès,” said Caderousse eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said the abbé, with a stifled sigh, “Mercédès it
      was.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on,” urged Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bring me a <i>carafe</i> of water,” said the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse quickly performed the stranger’s bidding; and after
      pouring some into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbé,
      resuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty glass
      on the table,—“Where did we leave off?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The name of Edmond’s betrothed was Mercédès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be sure. ‘You will go to Marseilles,’ said Dantès,—for
      you understand, I repeat his words just as he uttered them. Do you
      understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perfectly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘You will sell this diamond; you will divide the money into
      five equal parts, and give an equal portion to these good friends, the
      only persons who have loved me upon earth.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why into five parts?” asked Caderousse; “you only
      mentioned four persons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because the fifth is dead, as I hear. The fifth sharer in Edmond’s
      bequest, was his own father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Too true, too true!” ejaculated Caderousse, almost suffocated
      by the contending passions which assailed him, “the poor old man did
      die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I learned so much at Marseilles,” replied the abbé, making a
      strong effort to appear indifferent; “but from the length of time
      that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dantès, I was unable to
      obtain any particulars of his end. Can you enlighten me on that point?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know who could if I could not,” said Caderousse.
      “Why, I lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man. Ah,
      yes, about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man
      died.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of what did he die?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, I believe;
      his acquaintances say he died of grief; but I, who saw him in his dying
      moments, I say he died of——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of what?” asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, of downright starvation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Starvation!” exclaimed the abbé, springing from his seat.
      “Why, the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as
      that. The very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find
      some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a
      Christian, should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men
      who call themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief. Oh, it is
      impossible—utterly impossible!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What I have said, I have said,” answered Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you are a fool for having said anything about it,” said a
      voice from the top of the stairs. “Why should you meddle with what
      does not concern you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of La Carconte
      peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of voices, she
      had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated on the lower step,
      head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing conversation. “Mind
      your own business, wife,” replied Caderousse sharply. “This
      gentleman asks me for information, which common politeness will not permit
      me to refuse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Politeness, you simpleton!” retorted La Carconte. “What
      have you to do with politeness, I should like to know? Better study a
      little common prudence. How do you know the motives that person may have
      for trying to extract all he can from you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I pledge you my word, madam,” said the abbé, “that my
      intentions are good; and that your husband can incur no risk, provided he
      answers me candidly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that’s all very fine,” retorted the woman. “Nothing
      is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to
      fear; but when poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been
      persuaded to tell all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are
      quickly forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold
      trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the
      unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions
      come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of
      you. Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my
      instrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again
      drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two speakers
      to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to hear every
      word they uttered. Again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of
      water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him. When he had
      sufficiently recovered himself, he said, “It appears, then, that the
      miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone. Surely,
      had not such been the case, he would not have perished by so dreadful a
      death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, he was not altogether forsaken,” continued Caderousse,
      “for Mercédès the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him;
      but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for Fernand—the
      very person,” added Caderousse with a bitter smile, “that you
      named just now as being one of Dantès’ faithful and attached
      friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And was he not so?” asked the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gaspard, Gaspard!” murmured the woman, from her seat on the
      stairs, “mind what you are saying!” Caderousse made no reply
      to these words, though evidently irritated and annoyed by the
      interruption, but, addressing the abbé, said, “Can a man be faithful
      to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself? But Dantès was so
      honorable and true in his own nature, that he believed everybody’s
      professions of friendship. Poor Edmond, he was cruelly deceived; but it
      was fortunate that he never knew, or he might have found it more
      difficult, when on his deathbed, to pardon his enemies. And, whatever
      people may say,” continued Caderousse, in his native language, which
      was not altogether devoid of rude poetry, “I cannot help being more
      frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of
      the living.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Imbecile!” exclaimed La Carconte.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you, then, know in what manner Fernand injured Dantès?”
      inquired the abbé of Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do I? No one better.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak out then, say what it was!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gaspard!” cried La Carconte, “do as you will; you are
      master—but if you take my advice you’ll hold your tongue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, wife,” replied Caderousse, “I don’t know
      but what you’re right!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So you will say nothing?” asked the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, what good would it do?” asked Caderousse. “If the
      poor lad were living, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell
      which were his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should
      not hesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have
      nothing to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried
      with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You prefer, then,” said the abbé, “that I should bestow
      on men you say are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful
      friendship?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is true enough,” returned Caderousse. “You say
      truly, the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand
      and Danglars; besides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of
      water in the ocean.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Remember,” chimed in La Carconte, “those two could
      crush you at a single blow!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?” inquired the abbé. “Are these persons, then,
      so rich and powerful?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you not know their history?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not. Pray relate it to me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments, then said, “No,
      truly, it would take up too much time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my good friend,” returned the abbé, in a tone that
      indicated utter indifference on his part, “you are at liberty,
      either to speak or be silent, just as you please; for my own part, I
      respect your scruples and admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. I
      shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the
      dying man. My first business will be to dispose of this diamond.” So
      saying, the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket, opened it, and
      contrived to hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of brilliant
      hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wife, wife!” cried he in a hoarse voice, “come here!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Diamond!” exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the
      chamber with a tolerably firm step; “what diamond are you talking
      about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, did you not hear all we said?” inquired Caderousse.
      “It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès, to be sold,
      and the money divided between his father, Mercédès, his betrothed bride,
      Fernand, Danglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand
      francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, what a magnificent jewel!” cried the astonished woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then,
      does it not?” asked Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It does,” replied the abbé; “with the addition of an
      equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès, which I believe
      myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why among us four?” inquired Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t call those friends who betray and ruin you,”
      murmured the wife in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course not!” rejoined Caderousse quickly; “no more
      do I, and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said
      I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery,
      perhaps crime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Remember,” answered the abbé calmly, as he replaced the jewel
      and its case in the pocket of his cassock, “it is your fault, not
      mine, that I do so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the
      address of both Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond’s
      last wishes.” The agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large
      drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbé rise
      from his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse
      were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his
      wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, you see, wife,” said the former, “this splendid
      diamond might all be ours, if we chose!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you believe it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied La Carconte, “do as you like. For my
      part, I wash my hands of the affair.” So saying, she once more
      climbed the staircase leading to her chamber, her body convulsed with
      chills, and her teeth rattling in her head, in spite of the intense heat
      of the weather. Arrived at the top stair, she turned round, and called
      out, in a warning tone, to her husband, “Gaspard, consider well what
      you are about to do!”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “I have both reflected and decided,” answered he. La Carconte
      then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy,
      uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her armchair, into which she
      fell as though exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” asked the abbé, as he returned to the apartment below,
      “what have you made up your mind to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To tell you all I know,” was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,” said the
      priest. “Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you
      may please to conceal from me, but simply that if, through your
      assistance, I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the
      testator, why, so much the better, that is all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope it may be so,” replied Caderousse, his face flushed
      with cupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am all attention,” said the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop a minute,” answered Caderousse; “we might be
      interrupted in the most interesting part of my story, which would be a
      pity; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only
      to ourselves.” With these words he went stealthily to the door,
      which he closed, and, by way of still greater precaution, bolted and
      barred it, as he was accustomed to do at night. During this time the abbé
      had chosen his place for listening at his ease. He removed his seat into a
      corner of the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the
      light would be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and
      hands clasped, or rather clenched together, he prepared to give his whole
      attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly
      opposite to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Remember, this is no affair of mine,” said the trembling
      voice of La Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she
      viewed the scene that was enacting below.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Enough, enough!” replied Caderousse; “say no more about
      it; I will take all the consequences upon myself.” And he began his
      story.

      Chapter 27. The Story
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>irst, sir,”
      said Caderousse, “you must make me a promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?” inquired the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you,
      that you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them; for
      the persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they
      only laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces like
      glass.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Make yourself easy, my friend,” replied the abbé. “I am
      a priest, and confessions die in my breast. Recollect, our only desire is
      to carry out, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. Speak,
      then, without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth;
      I do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak;
      besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to God, and not
      to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I have only
      quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.” This positive
      assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, under these circumstances,” said Caderousse,
      “I will, I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the
      friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Begin with his father, if you please.” said the abbé; “Edmond
      talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest
      love.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The history is a sad one, sir,” said Caderousse, shaking his
      head; “perhaps you know all the earlier part of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” answered the abbé; “Edmond related to me
      everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close
      to Marseilles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At La Réserve! Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was it not his betrothal feast?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful
      ending; a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and
      Dantès was arrested.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and up to this point I know all,” said the priest.
      “Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him, for
      he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard
      mention of anyone of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, when Dantès was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain
      the particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his
      home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up and
      down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for I was
      underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for myself, I
      assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor father gave
      me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart as really as
      if his foot had pressed against my breast. The next day Mercédès came to
      implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not obtain it, however,
      and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so miserable and
      heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not touched food since
      the previous day, she wished him to go with her that she might take care
      of him; but the old man would not consent. ‘No,’ was the old
      man’s reply, ‘I will not leave this house, for my poor dear
      boy loves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of
      prison he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if
      I did not wait here for him?’ I heard all this from the window, for
      I was anxious that Mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her,
      for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment’s
      repose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?”
      asked the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, sir,” replied Caderousse, “we cannot console those
      who will not be consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not
      why, but he seemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his
      sobs, and I could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached
      his door he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you,
      sir, all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was
      more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and hate
      the Jesuits, said then to myself, ‘It is really well, and I am very
      glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such
      excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or
      heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once,
      for I could not bear it.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor father!” murmured the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M.
      Morrel and Mercédès came to see him, but his door was closed; and,
      although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer. One
      day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercédès, and the poor
      girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console him, he
      said to her,—‘Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and
      instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy,
      for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.’ However
      well disposed a person may be, why you see we leave off after a time
      seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and so at last
      old Dantès was left all to himself, and I only saw from time to time
      strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to
      hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold by degrees
      what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the poor old fellow
      reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters’ rent, and
      they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which was
      granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into my apartment
      when he left his. For the first three days I heard him walking about as
      usual, but, on the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to him
      at all risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and
      saw him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told
      M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercédès. They both came immediately, M.
      Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of the
      bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I never
      shall forget the old man’s smile at this prescription. From that
      time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more;
      the doctor had put him on a diet.” The abbé uttered a kind of groan.
      “The story interests you, does it not, sir?” inquired
      Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the abbé, “it is very affecting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercédès came again, and she found him so altered that she was even
      more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M.
      Morrel’s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against
      his consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were
      actually frightened. Mercédès remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M.
      Morrel went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse
      on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctor’s order,
      the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of
      despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his
      misery, and saying to Mercédès, ‘If you ever see my Edmond again,
      tell him I die blessing him.’” The abbé rose from his chair,
      made two turns round the chamber, and pressed his trembling hand against
      his parched throat. “And you believe he died——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of hunger, sir, of hunger,” said Caderousse. “I am as
      certain of it as that we two are Christians.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was standing
      by him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed his seat,
      with red eyes and pale cheeks. “This was, indeed, a horrid event.”
      said he in a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The more so, sir, as it was men’s and not God’s doing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me of those men,” said the abbé, “and remember
      too,” he added in an almost menacing tone, “you have promised
      to tell me everything. Tell me, therefore, who are these men who killed
      the son with despair, and the father with famine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two men jealous of him, sir; one from love, and the other from
      ambition,—Fernand and Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How was this jealousy manifested? Speak on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which of the two denounced him? Which was the real delinquent?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Both, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where was this letter written?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At La Réserve, the day before the betrothal feast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Twas so, then—‘twas so, then,” murmured
      the abbé. “Oh, Faria, Faria, how well did you judge men and things!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did you please to say, sir?” asked Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing, nothing,” replied the priest; “go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that
      his writing might not be recognized, and Fernand who put it in the post.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” exclaimed the abbé suddenly, “you were there
      yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I!” said Caderousse, astonished; “who told you I was
      there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,—“No
      one; but in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an
      eye-witness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, true!” said Caderousse in a choking voice, “I was
      there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?” asked the
      abbé; “if not, you were an accomplice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” replied Caderousse, “they had made me drink to
      such an excess that I nearly lost all perception. I had only an indistinct
      understanding of what was passing around me. I said all that a man in such
      a state could say; but they both assured me that it was a jest they were
      carrying on, and perfectly harmless.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Next day—next day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what
      they had been doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when
      Dantès was arrested.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir, I was there, and very anxious to speak; but Danglars
      restrained me. ‘If he should really be guilty,’ said he,
      ‘and did really put in to the Island of Elba; if he is really
      charged with a letter for the Bonapartist committee at Paris, and if they
      find this letter upon him, those who have supported him will pass for his
      accomplices.’ I confess I had my fears, in the state in which
      politics then were, and I held my tongue. It was cowardly, I confess, but
      it was not criminal.”

    <p>
      “I understand—you allowed matters to take their course, that
      was all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” answered Caderousse; “and remorse preys on
      me night and day. I often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this
      action, the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all
      my life, is no doubt the cause of my abject condition. I am expiating a
      moment of selfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she
      complains, ‘Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.’”
      And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir,” said the abbé, “you have spoken
      unreservedly; and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He did not know,” said the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But he knows it all now,” interrupted Caderousse; “they
      say the dead know everything.” There was a brief silence; the abbé
      rose and paced up and down pensively, and then resumed his seat. “You
      have two or three times mentioned a M. Morrel,” he said; “who
      was he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The owner of the <i>Pharaon</i> and patron of Dantès.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what part did he play in this sad drama?” inquired the
      abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty
      times he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote,
      implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second restoration
      he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told you, he came to
      see Dantès’ father, and offered to receive him in his own house; and
      the night or two before his death, as I have already said, he left his
      purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old man’s debts,
      and buried him decently; and so Edmond’s father died, as he had
      lived, without doing harm to anyone. I have the purse still by me—a
      large one, made of red silk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And,” asked the abbé, “is M. Morrel still alive?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case,” replied the abbé, “he should be rich,
      happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse smiled bitterly. “Yes, happy as myself,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What! M. Morrel unhappy?” exclaimed the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is reduced almost to the last extremity—nay, he is almost
      at the point of dishonor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” continued Caderousse, “so it is; after five and
      twenty years of labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the
      trade of Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships
      in two years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and
      his only hope now is in that very <i>Pharaon</i> which poor Dantès
      commanded, and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal
      and indigo. If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And has the unfortunate man wife or children?” inquired the
      abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an
      angel; he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but
      whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man;
      he has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose,
      all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were
      alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an
      end.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Horrible!” ejaculated the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,” added
      Caderousse. “You see, I, who never did a bad action but that I have
      told you of—am in destitution, with my poor wife dying of fever
      before my very eyes, and I unable to do anything in the world for her; I
      shall die of hunger, as old Dantès did, while Fernand and Danglars are
      rolling in wealth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest
      men have been reduced to misery.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What has become of Danglars, the instigator, and therefore the most
      guilty?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What has become of him? Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on
      the recommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier
      into a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the
      commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that money
      he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital; and,
      having first married his banker’s daughter, who left him a widower,
      he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of
      M. de Servieux, the king’s chamberlain, who is in high favor at
      court. He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is
      the Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue de Mont-Blanc, with
      ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his antechamber, and I know not
      how many millions in his strongbox.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” said the abbé, in a peculiar tone, “he is happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the
      secret known but to one’s self and the walls—walls have ears
      but no tongue; but if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is
      happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And Fernand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fernand? Why, much the same story.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or
      resources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life
      some strange secret that no one knows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune
      or high position?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Both, sir—he has both fortune and position—both.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This must be impossible!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days
      before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left
      him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy
      was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was
      older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent to
      the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active troop, went to the frontier
      with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night after that
      battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret
      correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was to go over
      to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; Fernand agreed to
      do so, deserted his post, and followed the general. Fernand would have
      been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his
      action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the
      epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the general, who is in
      the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in 1823, during
      the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time when Danglars made his
      early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to
      ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got
      on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at
      the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on
      his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through
      the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact,
      rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of
      Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the
      cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,
      Fernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely
      to endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had
      begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it
      was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,
      without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to volunteer
      assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece,
      still having his name kept on the army roll. Some time after, it was
      stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had entered
      the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general. Ali Pasha
      was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed the services of
      Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he returned to
      France, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general.”

    <p>
      “So that now——?” inquired the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that now,” continued Caderousse, “he owns a
      magnificent house—No. 27, Rue du Helder, Paris.” The abbé
      opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, then, making an effort at
      self-control, he said, “And Mercédès—they tell me that she has
      disappeared?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Disappeared,” said Caderousse, “yes, as the sun
      disappears, to rise the next day with still more splendor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has she made a fortune also?” inquired the abbé, with an
      ironical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,”
      replied Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on,” said the abbé; “it seems as if I were listening
      to the story of a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that
      what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which
      deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M.
      de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dantès. In the midst of her
      despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of Fernand—of
      Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded as her
      brother. Fernand went, and Mercédès remained alone. Three months passed
      and still she wept—no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no
      companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One
      evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading
      to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed
      than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around,
      the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant,
      stood before her. It was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as
      if a part of her past life had returned to her. Mercédès seized Fernand’s
      hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at
      being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after
      long hours of solitary sorrow. And then, it must be confessed, Fernand had
      never been hated—he was only not precisely loved. Another possessed
      all Mercédès’ heart; that other was absent, had disappeared, perhaps
      was dead. At this last thought Mercédès burst into a flood of tears, and
      wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which she had always repelled
      before when it was suggested to her by another, came now in full force
      upon her mind; and then, too, old Dantès incessantly said to her, ‘Our
      Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would return to us.’ The old man
      died, as I have told you; had he lived, Mercédès, perchance, had not
      become the wife of another, for he would have been there to reproach her
      infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned of the old man’s
      death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his first coming he had not
      said a word of love to Mercédès; at the second he reminded her that he
      loved her. Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn
      for Edmond.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that
      makes eighteen months in all. What more could the most devoted lover
      desire?” Then he murmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty,
      thy name is woman.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the
      marriage took place in the church of Accoules.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,”
      murmured the priest; “there was only a change of bridegrooms.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Mercédès was married,” proceeded Caderousse; “but
      although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as
      she passed La Réserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had
      been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had
      she looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not more
      at his ease—for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of
      Edmond’s return—Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away,
      and to depart himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities
      associated with the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left
      Marseilles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you ever see Mercédès again?” inquired the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left
      her; she was attending to the education of her son.” The abbé
      started. “Her son?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Caderousse, “little Albert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, then, to be able to instruct her child,” continued the
      abbé, “she must have received an education herself. I understood
      from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but
      uneducated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” replied Caderousse, “did he know so little of his
      lovely betrothed? Mercédès might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were
      to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand’s
      fortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing
      fortune. She learned drawing, music—everything. Besides, I believe,
      between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she
      might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the
      weight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,”
      continued Caderousse; “no doubt fortune and honors have comforted
      her; she is rich, a countess, and yet——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet what?” asked the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,” said Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What makes you believe this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, when I found myself utterly destitute, I thought my old
      friends would, perhaps, assist me. So I went to Danglars, who would not
      even receive me. I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his
      valet-de-chambre.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you did not see either of them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but Madame de Morcerf saw me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I went away a purse fell at my feet—it contained five and
      twenty louis; I raised my head quickly, and saw Mercédès, who at once shut
      the blind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And M. de Villefort?” asked the abbé.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had
      nothing to ask of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmond’s
      misfortunes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; I only know that some time after Edmond’s arrest, he
      married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, and soon after left Marseilles; no
      doubt he has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as
      Danglars, as high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained
      poor, wretched, and forgotten.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are mistaken, my friend,” replied the abbé; “God
      may seem sometimes to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but
      there always comes a moment when he remembers—and behold—a
      proof!” As he spoke, the abbé took the diamond from his pocket, and
      giving it to Caderousse, said,—“Here, my friend, take this
      diamond, it is yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, for me only?” cried Caderousse, “ah, sir, do not
      jest with me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had
      one friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then,
      and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that
      this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sir,” said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and
      with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,—“Oh,
      sir, do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest
      of such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand. The abbé smiled.
      “In exchange,” he continued, “give me the red silk purse
      that M. Morrel left on old Dantès’ chimney-piece, and which you tell
      me is still in your hands.” Caderousse, more and more astonished,
      went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbé a long
      purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once
      been gilt. The abbé took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you are a man of God, sir,” cried Caderousse; “for
      no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have
      kept it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which,” said the abbé to himself, “you would have done.”
      The abbé rose, took his hat and gloves. “Well,” he said,
      “all you have told me is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it
      in every particular.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “See, sir,” replied Caderousse, “in this corner is a
      crucifix in holy wood—here on this shelf is my wife’s
      testament; open this book, and I will swear upon it with my hand on the
      crucifix. I will swear to you by my soul’s salvation, my faith as a
      Christian, I have told everything to you as it occurred, and as the
      recording angel will tell it to the ear of God at the day of the last
      judgment!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis well,” said the abbé, convinced by his manner and
      tone that Caderousse spoke the truth. “‘Tis well, and may this
      money profit you! Adieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure
      each other.” The abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic
      thanks of Caderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his
      horse, once more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud
      farewells, and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming. When
      Caderousse turned around, he saw behind him La Carconte, paler and
      trembling more than ever. “Is, then, all that I have heard really
      true?” she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? That he has given the diamond to us only?” inquired
      Caderousse, half bewildered with joy; “yes, nothing more true! See,
      here it is.” The woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a
      gloomy voice, “Suppose it’s false?” Caderousse started
      and turned pale. “False!” he muttered. “False! Why
      should that man give me a false diamond?”

    <p>
      “To get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea.
      “Oh!” he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red
      handkerchief tied round his head, “we will soon find out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from
      Paris there, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife, and I
      shall be back in two hours,” and Caderousse left the house in haste,
      and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had
      taken. “Fifty thousand francs!” muttered La Carconte when left
      alone; “it is a large sum of money, but it is not a fortune.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 28. The Prison Register
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he day after that
      in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road
      between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about thirty or two and thirty,
      dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen trousers, and a white
      waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of an Englishman, presented
      himself before the mayor of Marseilles. “Sir,” said he,
      “I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French, of Rome. We
      are, and have been these ten years, connected with the house of Morrel
      &amp; Son, of Marseilles. We have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts
      loaned on their securities, and we are a little uneasy at reports that
      have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin. I have come,
      therefore, express from Rome, to ask you for information.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” replied the mayor. “I know very well that during
      the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel. He
      has lost four or five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies;
      but it is not for me, although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten
      thousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his finances.
      Ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of M. Morrel, and I shall say that
      he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has up to this time
      fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality. This is all I can
      say, sir; if you wish to learn more, address yourself to M. de Boville,
      the inspector of prisons, No. 15, Rue de Nouailles; he has, I believe, two
      hundred thousand francs in Morrel’s hands, and if there be any
      grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount than mine, you will
      most probably find him better informed than myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow
      and went away, proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards the
      street mentioned. M. de Boville was in his private room, and the
      Englishman, on perceiving him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed to
      indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence. As to
      M. de Boville, he was in such a state of despair, that it was evident all
      the faculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which occupied him at
      the moment, did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to
      the past. The Englishman, with the coolness of his nation, addressed him
      in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of
      Marseilles. “Oh, sir,” exclaimed M. de Boville, “your
      fears are unfortunately but too well founded, and you see before you a man
      in despair. I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of
      Morrel &amp; Son; these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my
      daughter, who was to be married in a fortnight, and these two hundred
      thousand francs were payable, half on the 15th of this month, and the
      other half on the 15th of next month. I had informed M. Morrel of my
      desire to have these payments punctually, and he has been here within the
      last half-hour to tell me that if his ship, the <i>Pharaon</i>, did not
      come into port on the 15th, he would be wholly unable to make this
      payment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said the Englishman, “this looks very much like a
      suspension of payment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks more like bankruptcy!” exclaimed M. de Boville
      despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said,—“From
      which it would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with
      considerable apprehension?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To tell you the truth, I consider it lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, I will buy it of you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But at a tremendous discount, of course?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, for two hundred thousand francs. Our house,” added the
      Englishman with a laugh, “does not do things in that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you will pay——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ready money.” And the Englishman drew from his pocket a
      bundle of bank-notes, which might have been twice the sum M. de Boville
      feared to lose. A ray of joy passed across M. de Boville’s
      countenance, yet he made an effort at self-control, and said,—“Sir,
      I ought to tell you that, in all probability, you will not realize six per
      cent of this sum.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “That’s no affair of mine,” replied the Englishman,
      “that is the affair of the house of Thomson &amp; French, in whose
      name I act. They have, perhaps, some motive to serve in hastening the ruin
      of a rival firm. But all I know, sir, is, that I am ready to hand you over
      this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt. I only ask a
      brokerage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course, that is perfectly just,” cried M. de Boville.
      “The commission is usually one and a half; will you have two—three—five
      per cent, or even more? Whatever you say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” replied the Englishman, laughing, “I am like my
      house, and do not do such things—no, the commission I ask is quite
      different.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Name it, sir, I beg.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are the inspector of prisons?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have been so these fourteen years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You keep the registers of entries and departures?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are special reports on every prisoner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abbé, who
      disappeared suddenly. I have since learned that he was confined in the
      Château d’If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his
      death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was his name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Abbé Faria.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I recollect him perfectly,” cried M. de Boville; “he
      was crazy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So they said.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, he was, decidedly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums
      to the government if they would liberate him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor devil!—and he is dead?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir, five or six months ago—last February.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I recollect this, because the poor devil’s death was
      accompanied by a singular incident.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “May I ask what that was?” said the Englishman with an
      expression of curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished
      at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh dear, yes, sir; the abbé’s dungeon was forty or fifty feet
      distant from that of one of Bonaparte’s emissaries,—one of
      those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815,—a
      very resolute and very dangerous man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed!” said the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied M. de Boville; “I myself had occasion to
      see this man in 1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a
      file of soldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never
      forget his countenance!” The Englishman smiled imperceptibly.

    <p>
      “And you say, sir,” he interposed, “that the two
      dungeons——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that
      this Edmond Dantès——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This dangerous man’s name was——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Edmond Dantès. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantès had
      procured tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the
      prisoners held communication with one another.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbé Faria had
      an attack of catalepsy, and died.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That must have cut short the projects of escape.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For the dead man, yes,” replied M. de Boville, “but not
      for the survivor; on the contrary, this Dantès saw a means of accelerating
      his escape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château d’If
      were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the dead man
      into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up
      the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,”
      remarked the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,
      fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it
      had on his account.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How? Do you not comprehend?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Château d’If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the
      dead into the sea, after fastening a thirty-six pound cannon-ball to their
      feet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of
      comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, they fastened a thirty-six pound ball to his feet, and threw
      him into the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really!” exclaimed the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” continued the inspector of prisons. “You may
      imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong
      over the rocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That would have been difficult.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No matter,” replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the
      certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs,—“no
      matter, I can fancy it.” And he shouted with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So can I,” said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he
      laughed as the English do, “at the end of his teeth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so,” continued the Englishman who first gained his
      composure, “he was drowned?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unquestionably.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy
      prisoner at the same time?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely.”

    <p>
      “But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I
      suppose?” inquired the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition. You understand, Dantès’
      relations, if he had any, might have some interest in knowing if he were
      dead or alive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that now, if there were anything to inherit from him, they may
      do so with easy conscience. He is dead, and no mistake about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So be it,” said the Englishman. “But to return to these
      registers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, this story has diverted our attention from them. Excuse me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse you for what? For the story? By no means; it really seems to
      me very curious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, indeed. So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor
      abbé, who really was gentleness itself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you will much oblige me.”

      “Go into my study here, and I will show it to you.” And they
      both entered M. de Boville’s study. Everything was here arranged in
      perfect order; each register had its number, each file of papers its
      place. The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in an armchair,
      and placed before him the register and documents relative to the Château d’If,
      giving him all the time he desired for the examination, while De Boville
      seated himself in a corner, and began to read his newspaper. The
      Englishman easily found the entries relative to the Abbé Faria; but it
      seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him
      greatly, for after having perused the first documents he turned over the
      leaves until he reached the deposition respecting Edmond Dantès. There he
      found everything arranged in due order,—the accusation, examination,
      Morrel’s petition, M. de Villefort’s marginal notes. He folded
      up the accusation quietly, and put it as quietly in his pocket; read the
      examination, and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it;
      perused, too, the application dated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel, by
      the deputy procureur’s advice, exaggerated with the best intentions
      (for Napoleon was then on the throne) the services Dantès had rendered to
      the imperial cause—services which Villefort’s certificates
      rendered indisputable. Then he saw through the whole thing. This petition
      to Napoleon, kept back by Villefort, had become, under the second
      restoration, a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king’s
      attorney. He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the
      register this note, placed in a bracket against his name:—
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond Dantès.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inveterate Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the
      Island of Elba.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched and
      guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath these lines was written in another hand: “See note above—nothing
      can be done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate
      placed beneath Morrel’s petition, and discovered that the note in
      the bracket was the same writing as the certificate—that is to say,
      was in Villefort’s handwriting. As to the note which accompanied
      this, the Englishman understood that it might have been added by some
      inspector who had taken a momentary interest in Dantès’ situation,
      but who had, from the remarks we have quoted, found it impossible to give
      any effect to the interest he had felt.

    <p>
      As we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not
      disturb the Abbé Faria’s pupil in his researches, had seated himself
      in a corner, and was reading <i>Le Drapeau Blanc</i>. He did not see the
      Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by
      Danglars under the arbor of La Réserve, and which had the postmark,
      “Marseilles, 27th February, delivery 6 o’clock, P.M.”
      But it must be said that if he had seen it, he attached so little
      importance to this scrap of paper, and so much importance to his two
      hundred thousand francs, that he would not have opposed whatever the
      Englishman might do, however irregular it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks,” said the latter, closing the register with a slam,
      “I have all I want; now it is for me to perform my promise. Give me
      a simple assignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the
      cash, and I will hand you over the money.” He rose, gave his seat to
      M. de Boville, who took it without ceremony, and quickly drew up the
      required assignment, while the Englishman counted out the bank-notes on
      the other side of the desk.

    <h2>
      Chapter 29. The House of Morrel &amp; Son
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nyone who had
      quitted Marseilles a few years previously, well acquainted with the
      interior of Morrel’s warehouse, and had returned at this date, would
      have found a great change. Instead of that air of life, of comfort, and of
      happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business
      establishment—instead of merry faces at the windows, busy clerks
      hurrying to and fro in the long corridors—instead of the court
      filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of
      porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and
      gloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted
      corridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a young man of
      three or four and twenty, who was in love with M. Morrel’s daughter,
      and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce
      him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed cashier, called “Cocles,”
      or “Cock-eye,” a nickname given him by the young men who used
      to throng this vast now almost deserted bee-hive, and which had so
      completely replaced his real name that he would not, in all probability,
      have replied to any one who addressed him by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cocles remained in M. Morrel’s service, and a most singular change
      had taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank
      of cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant. He was, however, the same
      Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of
      arithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against the
      world, even against M. Morrel; and strong in the multiplication-table,
      which he had at his fingers’ ends, no matter what scheme or what
      trap was laid to catch him. In the midst of the disasters that befell the
      house, Cocles was the only one unmoved. But this did not arise from a want
      of affection; on the contrary, from a firm conviction. Like the rats that
      one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor,
      so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the
      warehouse. Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause
      of their departure. Everything was as we have said, a question of
      arithmetic to Cocles, and during twenty years he had always seen all
      payments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as impossible to him
      that the house should stop payment, as it would to a miller that the river
      that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles’ belief; the last month’s
      payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had
      detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same evening
      he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile, threw them
      into an almost empty drawer, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel, himself
      the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more than a
      present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M. Morrel had
      passed many an anxious hour. In order to meet the payments then due; he
      had collected all his resources, and, fearing lest the report of his
      distress should get bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be
      reduced to such an extremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his
      wife’s and daughter’s jewels and a portion of his plate. By
      this means the end of the month was passed, but his resources were now
      exhausted. Credit, owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had;
      and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 10th of the present
      month, and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next
      month to M. de Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return
      of the <i>Pharaon</i>, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel
      which had weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived
      in harbor. But this vessel which, like the <i>Pharaon</i>, came from
      Calcutta, had been in for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been
      received of the <i>Pharaon</i>.

    <p>
      Such was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M. de
      Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French of
      Rome, presented himself at M. Morrel’s. Emmanuel received him; this
      young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face, for every new
      face might be that of a new creditor, come in anxiety to question the head
      of the house. The young man, wishing to spare his employer the pain of
      this interview, questioned the new-comer; but the stranger declared that
      he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel, and that his business was with M.
      Morrel in person. Emmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles appeared,
      and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel’s
      apartment. Cocles went first, and the stranger followed him. On the
      staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen, who looked
      with anxiety at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?”
      said the cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I think so, at least,” said the young girl hesitatingly.
      “Go and see, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this
      gentleman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,” returned
      the Englishman. “M. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy
      gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of
      Thomson &amp; French of Rome, with whom your father does business.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger
      and Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office where
      Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed, opened a
      door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase, conducted
      the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which he closed
      behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of Thomson &amp;
      French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter. The
      Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning over the
      formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of his
      liabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the ledger,
      arose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen him
      seated, resumed his own chair. Fourteen years had changed the worthy
      merchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this history,
      was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and sorrow had
      ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so firm and
      penetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared being
      forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person. The
      Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently mingled with
      interest. “Monsieur,” said Morrel, whose uneasiness was
      increased by this examination, “you wish to speak to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom I come?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The house of Thomson &amp; French; at least, so my cashier tells
      me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has told you rightly. The house of Thomson &amp; French had
      300,000 or 400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your
      strict punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature,
      and charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money
      otherwise.” Morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his
      forehead, which was covered with perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So then, sir,” said Morrel, “you hold bills of mine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and for a considerable sum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the amount?” asked Morrel with a voice he strove to
      render firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here is,” said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers
      from his pocket, “an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M.
      de Boville, the inspector of prisons, to whom they are due. You
      acknowledge, of course, that you owe this sum to him?”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent
      nearly five years ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When are you to pay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are
      all signed by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I recognize them,” said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as
      he thought that, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to
      honor his own signature. “Is this all?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been
      assigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild &amp; Turner
      of Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000. francs; in all, 287,500 francs.”
      It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumeration.
      “Two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs,”
      repeated he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” replied the Englishman. “I will not,”
      continued he, after a moment’s silence, “conceal from you,
      that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally
      acknowledged, yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not
      able to meet your liabilities.” At this almost brutal speech Morrel
      turned deathly pale. “Sir,” said he, “up to this time—and
      it is now more than four-and-twenty years since I received the direction
      of this house from my father, who had himself conducted it for five and
      thirty years—never has anything bearing the signature of Morrel
      &amp; Son been dishonored.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know that,” replied the Englishman. “But as a man of
      honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the
      same punctuality?” Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who
      spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown. “To questions
      frankly put,” said he, “a straightforward answer should be
      given. Yes, I shall pay, if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely; for its
      arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of
      which I have been the victim, have deprived me; but if the <i>Pharaon</i>
      should be lost, and this last resource be gone——”
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man’s eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said the other, “if this last resource fail you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” returned Morrel, “it is a cruel thing to be
      forced to say, but, already used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to
      shame. I fear I shall be forced to suspend payment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you no friends who could assist you?” Morrel smiled
      mournfully. “In business, sir,” said he, “one has no
      friends, only correspondents.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is true,” murmured the Englishman; “then you have
      but one hope.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The last?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The last.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that if this fail——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am ruined,—completely ruined!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen
      fortunes, passes a part of his time in a belvidere at the top of the
      house, in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has
      informed me of the arrival of this ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it is not yours?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, she is a Bordeaux vessel, <i>La Gironde</i>; she comes from
      India also; but she is not mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps she has spoken to the <i>Pharaon</i>, and brings you some
      tidings of her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I tell you plainly one thing, sir? I dread almost as much to
      receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt. Uncertainty is
      still hope.” Then in a low voice Morrel added,—“This
      delay is not natural. The <i>Pharaon</i> left Calcutta the 5th of
      February; she ought to have been here a month ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?” said the Englishman. “What is the
      meaning of that noise?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, oh!” cried Morrel, turning pale, “what is it?”
      A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and
      half-stifled sobs. Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength
      failed him and he sank into a chair. The two men remained opposite one
      another, Morrel trembling in every limb, the stranger gazing at him with
      an air of profound pity. The noise had ceased; but it seemed that Morrel
      expected something—something had occasioned the noise, and something
      must follow. The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and
      that the footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the
      door. A key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and the creaking
      of hinges was audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are only two persons who have the key to that door,”
      murmured Morrel, “Cocles and Julie.” At this instant the
      second door opened, and the young girl, her eyes bathed with tears,
      appeared. Morrel rose tremblingly, supporting himself by the arm of the
      chair. He would have spoken, but his voice failed him. “Oh, father!”
      said she, clasping her hands, “forgive your child for being the
      bearer of evil tidings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, father, father!” murmured she, “courage!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Pharaon</i> has gone down, then?” said Morrel in a
      hoarse voice. The young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative
      sign with her head as she lay on her father’s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the crew?” asked Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Saved,” said the girl; “saved by the crew of the vessel
      that has just entered the harbor.” Morrel raised his two hands to
      heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude. “Thanks,
      my God,” said he, “at least thou strikest but me alone.”
      A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in, come in,” said Morrel, “for I presume you are
      all at the door.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he uttered those words than Madame Morrel entered weeping
      bitterly. Emmanuel followed her, and in the antechamber were visible the
      rough faces of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of these
      men the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained himself,
      and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment.
      Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers,
      Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel stood in the
      centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrel’s
      family and the sailors at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did this happen?” said Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Draw nearer, Penelon,” said the young man, “and tell us
      all about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      An old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the remains
      of a hat between his hands. “Good-day, M. Morrel,” said he, as
      if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening, and had just
      returned from Aix or Toulon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-day, Penelon,” returned Morrel, who could not refrain
      from smiling through his tears, “where is the captain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The captain, M. Morrel,—he has stayed behind sick at Palma;
      but please God, it won’t be much, and you will see him in a few days
      all alive and hearty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, now tell your story, Penelon.”

    <p>
      Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his mouth,
      turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the
      antechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began,—“You
      see, M. Morrel,” said he, “we were somewhere between Cape
      Blanc and Cape Boyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after
      a week’s calm, when Captain Gaumard comes up to me—I was at
      the helm I should tell you—and says, ‘Penelon, what do you
      think of those clouds coming up over there?’ I was just then looking
      at them myself. ‘What do I think, captain? Why I think that they are
      rising faster than they have any business to do, and that they would not
      be so black if they didn’t mean mischief.’—‘That’s
      my opinion too,’ said the captain, ‘and I’ll take
      precautions accordingly. We are carrying too much canvas. Avast, there,
      all hands! Take in the studding-sails and stow the flying jib.’ It
      was time; the squall was on us, and the vessel began to heel. ‘Ah,’
      said the captain, ‘we have still too much canvas set; all hands
      lower the mainsail!’ Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed
      under mizzen-topsails and top-gallant sails. ‘Well, Penelon,’
      said the captain, ‘what makes you shake your head?’ ‘Why,’
      I says, ‘I still think you’ve got too much on.’ ‘I
      think you’re right,’ answered he, ‘we shall have a gale.’
      ‘A gale? More than that, we shall have a tempest, or I don’t
      know what’s what.’ You could see the wind coming like the dust
      at Montredon; luckily the captain understood his business. ‘Take in
      two reefs in the top-sails,’ cried the captain; ‘let go the
      bowlin’s, haul the brace, lower the top-gallant sails, haul out the
      reef-tackles on the yards.’”

    <p>
      “That was not enough for those latitudes,” said the
      Englishman; “I should have taken four reefs in the topsails and
      furled the spanker.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made everyone start. Penelon put
      his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus criticized the
      manœuvres of his captain. “We did better than that, sir,” said
      the old sailor respectfully; “we put the helm up to run before the
      tempest; ten minutes after we struck our top-sails and scudded under bare
      poles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The vessel was very old to risk that,” said the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for
      twelve hours we sprung a leak. ‘Penelon,’ said the captain,
      ‘I think we are sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the
      hold.’ I gave him the helm, and descended; there was already three
      feet of water. ‘All hands to the pumps!’ I shouted; but it was
      too late, and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in. ‘Ah,’
      said I, after four hours’ work, ‘since we are sinking, let us
      sink; we can die but once.’ ‘Is that the example you set,
      Penelon?’ cries the captain; ‘very well, wait a minute.’
      He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols. ‘I
      will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,’ said
      he.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well done!” said the Englishman.

    <p>
      “There’s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,”
      continued the sailor; “and during that time the wind had abated, and
      the sea gone down, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an
      hour, but still it rose. Two inches an hour does not seem much, but in
      twelve hours that makes two feet, and three we had before, that makes
      five. ‘Come,’ said the captain, ‘we have done all in our
      power, and M. Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried
      to save the ship, let us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as
      quick as you can.’ Now,” continued Penelon, “you see, M.
      Morrel, a sailor is attached to his ship, but still more to his life, so
      we did not wait to be told twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking
      under us, and seemed to say, ‘Get along—save yourselves.’
      We soon launched the boat, and all eight of us got into it. The captain
      descended last, or rather, he did not descend, he would not quit the
      vessel; so I took him round the waist, and threw him into the boat, and
      then I jumped after him. It was time, for just as I jumped the deck burst
      with a noise like the broadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she
      pitched forward, then the other way, spun round and round, and then
      good-bye to the <i>Pharaon</i>. As for us, we were three days without
      anything to eat or drink, so that we began to think of drawing lots who
      should feed the rest, when we saw <i>La Gironde</i>; we made signals of
      distress, she perceived us, made for us, and took us all on board. There
      now, M. Morrel, that’s the whole truth, on the honor of a sailor; is
      not it true, you fellows there?” A general murmur of approbation
      showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and
      sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well,” said M. Morrel, “I know there was no one
      in fault but destiny. It was the will of God that this should happen,
      blessed be his name. What wages are due to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, don’t let us talk of that, M. Morrel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but we will talk of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, three months,” said Penelon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows,”
      said Morrel. “At another time,” added he, “I should have
      said, Give them, besides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times
      are changed, and the little money that remains to me is not my own.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for that, M. Morrel,” said he, again turning his quid,
      “as for that——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at
      present, and that we will wait for the rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, my friends, thanks!” cried Morrel gratefully; “take
      it—take it; and if you can find another employer, enter his service;
      you are free to do so.” These last words produced a prodigious
      effect on the seaman. Penelon nearly swallowed his quid; fortunately he
      recovered. “What, M. Morrel!” said he in a low voice, “you
      send us away; you are then angry with us!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” said M. Morrel, “I am not angry, quite the
      contrary, and I do not send you away; but I have no more ships, and
      therefore I do not want any sailors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No more ships!” returned Penelon; “well, then, you’ll
      build some; we’ll wait for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have no money to build ships with, Penelon,” said the poor
      owner mournfully, “so I cannot accept your kind offer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No more money? Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the <i>Pharaon</i>,
      under bare poles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Enough, enough!” cried Morrel, almost overpowered; “leave
      me, I pray you; we shall meet again in a happier time. Emmanuel, go with
      them, and see that my orders are executed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?” asked
      Penelon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I hope so, at least. Now go.” He made a sign to Cocles,
      who went first; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear.
      “Now,” said the owner to his wife and daughter, “leave
      me; I wish to speak with this gentleman.” And he glanced towards the
      clerk of Thomson &amp; French, who had remained motionless in the corner
      during this scene, in which he had taken no part, except the few words we
      have mentioned. The two women looked at this person whose presence they
      had entirely forgotten, and retired; but, as she left the apartment, Julie
      gave the stranger a supplicating glance, to which he replied by a smile
      that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his
      stern features. The two men were left alone. “Well, sir,” said
      Morrel, sinking into a chair, “you have heard all, and I have
      nothing further to tell you.”

    <p>
      “I see,” returned the Englishman, “that a fresh and
      unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you, and this only increases my
      desire to serve you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sir!” cried Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me see,” continued the stranger, “I am one of your
      largest creditors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you wish for time to pay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long a delay do you wish for?”—Morrel reflected.
      “Two months,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will give you three,” replied the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” asked Morrel, “will the house of Thomson &amp;
      French consent?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I take everything on myself. Today is the 5th of June.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th
      of September at eleven o’clock (the hand of the clock pointed to
      eleven), I shall come to receive the money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall expect you,” returned Morrel; “and I will pay
      you—or I shall be dead.” These last words were uttered in so
      low a tone that the stranger could not hear them. The bills were renewed,
      the old ones destroyed, and the poor ship-owner found himself with three
      months before him to collect his resources. The Englishman received his
      thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming
      him with grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. The stranger
      met Julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality
      she was waiting for him. “Oh, sir”—said she, clasping
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle,” said the stranger, “one day you will
      receive a letter signed ‘Sinbad the Sailor.’ Do exactly what
      the letter bids you, however strange it may appear.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” returned Julie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you promise?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I swear to you I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet
      girl you are at present, and I have great hopes that heaven will reward
      you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Julie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the
      baluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In the
      court he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either
      hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. “Come with
      me, my friend,” said the Englishman; “I wish to speak to you.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 30. The Fifth of September
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he extension
      provided for by the agent of Thomson &amp; French, at the moment when
      Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of
      good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown
      weary of wasting her spite upon him. The same day he told his wife,
      Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred; and a ray of hope, if
      not of tranquillity, returned to the family. Unfortunately, however,
      Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson &amp; French,
      who had shown themselves so considerate towards him; and, as he had said,
      in business he had correspondents, and not friends. When he thought the
      matter over, he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the
      part of Thomson &amp; French towards him; and could only attribute it to
      some such selfish argument as this:—“We had better help a man
      who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those 300,000 francs at the
      end of three months than hasten his ruin, and get only six or eight per
      cent of our money back again.” Unfortunately, whether through envy
      or stupidity, all Morrel’s correspondents did not take this view;
      and some even came to a contrary decision. The bills signed by Morrel were
      presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude, and, thanks to the
      delay granted by the Englishman, were paid by Cocles with equal
      punctuality. Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity. It was
      Morrel alone who remembered with alarm, that if he had to repay on the
      15th the 50,000 francs of M. de Boville, and on the 30th the 32,500 francs
      of bills, for which, as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons,
      he had time granted, he must be a ruined man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion of all the commercial men was that, under the reverses which
      had successively weighed down Morrel, it was impossible for him to remain
      solvent. Great, therefore, was the astonishment when at the end of the
      month, he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality. Still
      confidence was not restored to all minds, and the general opinion was that
      the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only
      until the end of the month. The month passed, and Morrel made
      extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources. Formerly his paper, at
      any date, was taken with confidence, and was even in request. Morrel now
      tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only, and none of the banks would
      give him credit. Fortunately, Morrel had some funds coming in on which he
      could rely; and, as they reached him, he found himself in a condition to
      meet his engagements when the end of July came. The agent of Thomson &amp;
      French had not been again seen at Marseilles; the day after, or two days
      after his visit to Morrel, he had disappeared; and as in that city he had
      had no intercourse but with the mayor, the inspector of prisons, and M.
      Morrel, his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three
      persons. As to the sailors of the <i>Pharaon</i>, they must have found
      snug berths elsewhere, for they also had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma. He
      delayed presenting himself at Morrel’s, but the owner, hearing of
      his arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon’s
      recital, of the captain’s brave conduct during the storm, and tried
      to console him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain
      Gaumard had not dared to apply for. As he descended the staircase, Morrel
      met Penelon, who was going up. Penelon had, it would seem, made good use
      of his money, for he was newly clad. When he saw his employer, the worthy
      tar seemed much embarrassed, drew on one side into the corner of the
      landing-place, passed his quid from one cheek to the other, stared
      stupidly with his great eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze of the
      hand which Morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return. Morrel
      attributed Penelon’s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it
      was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own
      account; he was, no doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus
      his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so
      express ourselves, worn mourning for the <i>Pharaon</i> longer. Perhaps he
      had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him
      employment from his new master. “Worthy fellows!” said Morrel,
      as he went away, “may your new master love you as I loved you, and
      be more fortunate than I have been!”

    <p>
      August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew his
      credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at Marseilles
      that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said that the
      bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that Morrel had
      gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier Cocles, to
      meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when the 31st of
      August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared behind the
      grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with the usual
      scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual precision.
      There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had fully anticipated,
      and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had
      accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and then, with the tenacity
      peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure was put off until the end of
      September. On the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with
      extreme anxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things.
      Morrel had thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain
      under great obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was
      owing that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom
      he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth. It was said at this moment
      that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs, and had
      unlimited credit. Danglars, then, without taking a crown from his pocket,
      could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and Morrel was
      saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept away from some
      instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible availing himself
      of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he returned home crushed
      by the humiliation of a refusal. Yet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter
      a complaint, or say one harsh word. He embraced his weeping wife and
      daughter, pressed Emmanuel’s hand with friendly warmth, and then
      going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Cocles. “Then,”
      said the two women to Emmanuel, “we are indeed ruined.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should write
      to her brother, who was in garrison at Nîmes, to come to them as speedily
      as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they required all
      their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides, Maximilian
      Morrel, though hardly two and twenty, had great influence over his father.
      He was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time when he decided on
      his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had
      consulted young Maximilian’s taste. He had at once declared for a
      military life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly
      through the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the 53d
      of the line. For a year he had held this rank, and expected promotion on
      the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was noted for his
      rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier, but
      also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name of “the
      stoic.” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this
      epithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know what
      it meant. This was the young man whom his mother and sister called to
      their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they
      would soon have to endure. They had not mistaken the gravity of this
      event, for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with
      Cocles, Julie saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features
      betraying the utmost consternation. She would have questioned him as he
      passed by her, but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with
      unusual precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed,
      “Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, what a dreadful misfortune! Who
      could ever have believed it!” A moment afterwards Julie saw him go
      upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the money.
      All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills receivable up
      to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of everything, gave
      him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500 francs. He had not
      even the means for making a possible settlement on account. However, when
      Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm. This calmness was
      more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been.
      After dinner Morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the
      club of the Phocéens, and read the <i>Semaphore</i>; this day he did not
      leave the house, but returned to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he went
      into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare and
      exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women, but his
      eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with the
      business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the
      Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping that when he
      left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard him pass before
      their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps. They
      listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened the door inside.
      Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an hour after Julie had
      retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went stealthily along the
      passage, to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing. In the
      passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who, uneasy herself,
      had anticipated her mother. The young lady went towards Madame Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is writing,” she said. They had understood each other
      without speaking. Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole, Morrel
      was writing; but Madame Morrel remarked, what her daughter had not
      observed, that her husband was writing on stamped paper. The terrible idea
      that he was writing his will flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet
      had not strength to utter a word. Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as
      ever, went into his office as usual, came to his breakfast punctually, and
      then, after dinner, he placed his daughter beside him, took her head in
      his arms, and held her for a long time against his bosom. In the evening,
      Julie told her mother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had
      noticed that her father’s heart beat violently. The next two days
      passed in much the same way. On the evening of the 4th of September, M.
      Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study. Julie trembled at this
      request, which seemed to her of bad omen. Why did her father ask for this
      key which she always kept, and which was only taken from her in childhood
      as a punishment? The young girl looked at Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What have I done wrong, father,” she said, “that you
      should take this key from me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing, my dear,” replied the unhappy man, the tears
      starting to his eyes at this simple question,—“nothing, only I
      want it.” Julie made a pretence to feel for the key. “I must
      have left it in my room,” she said. And she went out, but instead of
      going to her apartment she hastened to consult Emmanuel. “Do not
      give this key to your father,” said he, “and tomorrow morning,
      if possible, do not quit him for a moment.” She questioned Emmanuel,
      but he knew nothing, or would not say what he knew. During the night,
      between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel remained listening for
      every sound, and, until three o’clock in the morning, she heard her
      husband pacing the room in great agitation. It was three o’clock
      when he threw himself on the bed. The mother and daughter passed the night
      together. They had expected Maximilian since the previous evening. At
      eight o’clock in the morning Morrel entered their chamber. He was
      calm; but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn
      visage. They did not dare to ask him how he had slept. Morrel was kinder
      to his wife, more affectionate to his daughter, than he had ever been. He
      could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of
      Emmanuel’s request, was following her father when he quitted the
      room, but he said to her quickly,—“Remain with your mother,
      dearest.” Julie wished to accompany him. “I wish you to do so,”
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in a
      tone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She remained
      at the same spot standing mute and motionless. An instant afterwards the
      door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth pressed her
      forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Maximilian, my dearest brother!” she cried. At these words
      Madame Morrel rose, and threw herself into her son’s arms. “Mother,”
      said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter,
      “what has occurred—what has happened? Your letter has
      frightened me, and I have come hither with all speed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Julie,” said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man,
      “go and tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived.”
      The young lady rushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of the
      staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?” inquired the man,
      with a strong Italian accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” replied Julie with hesitation; “what is your
      pleasure? I do not know you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Read this letter,” he said, handing it to her. Julie
      hesitated. “It concerns the best interests of your father,”
      said the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly and
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go this moment to the Allées de Meillan, enter the house No. 15,
      ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the
      apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red
      silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should receive
      it before eleven o’clock. You promised to obey me implicitly.
      Remember your oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sinbad the Sailor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to
      question the messenger, but he had disappeared. She cast her eyes again
      over the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a postscript.
      She read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and
      alone. If you go accompanied by any other person, or should anyone else go
      in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything about
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This postscript decreased greatly the young girl’s happiness. Was
      there nothing to fear? was there not some snare laid for her? Her
      innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a
      young girl of her age. But there is no need to know danger in order to
      fear it; indeed, it may be observed, that it is usually unknown perils
      that inspire the greatest terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel. Yet, through a singular
      impulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied,
      but to Emmanuel. She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the
      day when the agent of Thomson &amp; French had come to her father’s,
      related the scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made, and
      showed him the letter. “You must go, then, mademoiselle,” said
      Emmanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go there?” murmured Julie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I will accompany you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But did you not read that I must be alone?” said Julie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you shall be alone,” replied the young man. “I will
      await you at the corner of the Rue de Musée, and if you are so long absent
      as to make me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom
      you shall have cause to complain to me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, Emmanuel?” said the young girl with hesitation, “it
      is your opinion that I should obey this invitation?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. Did not the messenger say your father’s safety depended
      upon it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what danger threatens him, then, Emmanuel?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide
      immediately made him reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen,” he said; “today is the 5th of September, is it
      not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Today, then, at eleven o’clock, your father has nearly three
      hundred thousand francs to pay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, we know that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” continued Emmanuel, “we have not fifteen
      thousand francs in the house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What will happen then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, if today before eleven o’clock your father has not found
      someone who will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve o’clock
      to declare himself a bankrupt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, come, then, come!” cried she, hastening away with the
      young man. During this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything.
      The young man knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes
      which had befallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style
      of living and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached
      such a point. He was thunderstruck. Then, rushing hastily out of the
      apartment, he ran upstairs, expecting to find his father in his study, but
      he rapped there in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open,
      turned, and saw his father. Instead of going direct to his study, M.
      Morrel had returned to his bedchamber, which he was only this moment
      quitting. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son, of
      whose arrival he was ignorant. He remained motionless on the spot,
      pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat.
      Maximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his father’s
      neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on Morrel’s
      breast. “Father,” he exclaimed, turning pale as death, “what
      are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, this is what I feared!” said Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father, father, in heaven’s name,” exclaimed the young
      man, “what are these weapons for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maximilian,” replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son,
      “you are a man, and a man of honor. Come, and I will explain to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian
      followed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed it
      behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on which he
      placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open ledger. In this
      ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his affairs. Morrel had to
      pay, within half an hour, 287,500 francs. All he possessed was 15,257
      francs. “Read!” said Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was overwhelmed as he read. Morrel said not a word. What
      could he say? What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?”
      And have you done all that is possible, father, to meet this disastrous
      result?” asked the young man, after a moment’s pause. “I
      have,” replied Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have no money coming in on which you can rely?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have exhausted every resource?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And in half an hour,” said Maximilian in a gloomy voice,
      “our name is dishonored!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blood washes out dishonor,” said Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, father; I understand you.” Then extending his
      hand towards one of the pistols, he said, “There is one for you and
      one for me—thanks!” Morrel caught his hand. “Your mother—your
      sister! Who will support them?” A shudder ran through the young man’s
      frame. “Father,” he said, “do you reflect that you are
      bidding me to live?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I do so bid you,” answered Morrel, “it is your
      duty. You have a calm, strong mind, Maximilian. Maximilian, you are no
      ordinary man. I make no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my
      position as if it were your own, and then judge for yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man reflected for a moment, then an expression of sublime
      resignation appeared in his eyes, and with a slow and sad gesture he took
      off his two epaulets, the insignia of his rank. “Be it so, then, my
      father,” he said, extending his hand to Morrel, “die in peace,
      my father; I will live.” Morrel was about to cast himself on his
      knees before his son, but Maximilian caught him in his arms, and those two
      noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment. “You know
      it is not my fault,” said Morrel. Maximilian smiled. “I know,
      father, you are the most honorable man I have ever known.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Good, my son. And now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin
      your mother and sister.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father,” said the young man, bending his knee, “bless
      me!” Morrel took the head of his son between his two hands, drew him
      forward, and kissing his forehead several times said, “Oh, yes, yes,
      I bless you in my own name, and in the name of three generations of
      irreproachable men, who say through me, ‘The edifice which
      misfortune has destroyed, providence may build up again.’ On seeing
      me die such a death, the most inexorable will have pity on you. To you,
      perhaps, they will accord the time they have refused to me. Then do your
      best to keep our name free from dishonor. Go to work, labor, young man,
      struggle ardently and courageously; live, yourself, your mother and
      sister, with the most rigid economy, so that from day to day the property
      of those whom I leave in your hands may augment and fructify. Reflect how
      glorious a day it will be, how grand, how solemn, that day of complete
      restoration, on which you will say in this very office, ‘My father
      died because he could not do what I have this day done; but he died calmly
      and peaceably, because in dying he knew what I should do.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father, my father!” cried the young man, “why should
      you not live?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I live, all would be changed; if I live, interest would be
      converted into doubt, pity into hostility; if I live I am only a man who
      has broken his word, failed in his engagements—in fact, only a
      bankrupt. If, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse is
      that of an honest but unfortunate man. Living, my best friends would avoid
      my house; dead, all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home.
      Living, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your head and
      say, ‘I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first time,
      he has been compelled to break his word.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man uttered a groan, but appeared resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now,” said Morrel, “leave me alone, and endeavor to
      keep your mother and sister away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you not see my sister once more?” asked Maximilian. A
      last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this
      interview, and therefore he had suggested it. Morrel shook his head.
      “I saw her this morning, and bade her adieu.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?”
      inquired Maximilian in a faltering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; my son, and a sacred command.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say it, my father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The house of Thomson &amp; French is the only one who, from
      humanity, or, it may be, selfishness—it is not for me to read men’s
      hearts—has had any pity for me. Its agent, who will in ten minutes
      present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will
      not say granted, but offered me three months. Let this house be the first
      repaid, my son, and respect this man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Father, I will,” said Maximilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now, once more, adieu,” said Morrel. “Go, leave me;
      I would be alone. You will find my will in the secretary in my bedroom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of
      will and not the power of execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hear me, Maximilian,” said his father. “Suppose I was a
      soldier like you, and ordered to carry a certain redoubt, and you knew I
      must be killed in the assault, would you not say to me, as you said just
      now, ‘Go, father; for you are dishonored by delay, and death is
      preferable to shame!’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes,” said the young man, “yes;” and once
      again embracing his father with convulsive pressure, he said, “Be it
      so, my father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And he rushed out of the study. When his son had left him, Morrel remained
      an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door; then putting forth
      his arm, he pulled the bell. After a moment’s interval, Cocles
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no longer the same man—the fearful revelations of the three
      last days had crushed him. This thought—the house of Morrel is about
      to stop payment—bent him to the earth more than twenty years would
      otherwise have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My worthy Cocles,” said Morrel in a tone impossible to
      describe, “do you remain in the antechamber. When the gentleman who
      came three months ago—the agent of Thomson &amp; French—arrives,
      announce his arrival to me.” Cocles made no reply; he made a sign
      with his head, went into the anteroom, and seated himself. Morrel fell
      back in his chair, his eyes fixed on the clock; there were seven minutes
      left, that was all. The hand moved on with incredible rapidity, he seemed
      to see its motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony
      cannot be told in words. He was still comparatively young, he was
      surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family, but he had convinced
      himself by a course of reasoning, illogical perhaps, yet certainly
      plausible, that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the
      world, even life itself. To form the slightest idea of his feelings, one
      must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and
      its tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven. The minute hand moved on. The
      pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand, took one up, and
      murmured his daughter’s name. Then he laid it down, seized his pen,
      and wrote a few words. It seemed to him as if he had not taken a
      sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter. Then he turned again to the
      clock, counting time now not by minutes, but by seconds. He took up the
      deadly weapon again, his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock, and
      then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol. At
      this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow, a
      pang stronger than death clutched at his heart-strings. He heard the door
      of the staircase creak on its hinges—the clock gave its warning to
      strike eleven—the door of his study opened; Morrel did not turn
      round—he expected these words of Cocles, “The agent of Thomson
      &amp; French.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth. Suddenly he heard a
      cry—it was his daughter’s voice. He turned and saw Julie. The
      pistol fell from his hands. “My father!” cried the young girl,
      out of breath, and half dead with joy—“saved, you are saved!”
      And she threw herself into his arms, holding in her extended hand a red,
      netted silk purse.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Saved, my child!” said Morrel; “what do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, saved—saved! See, see!” said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague remembrance
      reminded him that it once belonged to himself. At one end was the
      receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a diamond as
      large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of parchment: <i>Julie’s
      Dowry</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this
      moment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer
      fell upon his heart. “Explain, my child,” he said, “Explain,
      my child,” he said, “explain—where did you find this
      purse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In a house in the Allées de Meillan, No. 15, on the corner of a
      mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” cried Morrel, “this purse is not yours!”
      Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And did you go alone?” asked Morrel, after he had read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Emmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at
      the corner of the Rue de Musée, but, strange to say, he was not there when
      I returned.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur Morrel!” exclaimed a voice on the stairs.—“Monsieur
      Morrel!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is his voice!” said Julie. At this moment Emmanuel
      entered, his countenance full of animation and joy. “The <i>Pharaon</i>!”
      he cried; “the <i>Pharaon</i>!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What—what—the <i>Pharaon</i>! Are you mad, Emmanuel?
      You know the vessel is lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Pharaon</i>, sir—they signal the <i>Pharaon</i>! The
      <i>Pharaon</i> is entering the harbor!” Morrel fell back in his
      chair, his strength was failing him; his understanding weakened by such
      events, refused to comprehend such incredible, unheard-of, fabulous facts.
      But his son came in. “Father,” cried Maximilian, “how
      could you say the <i>Pharaon</i> was lost? The lookout has signalled her,
      and they say she is now coming into port.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “My dear friends,” said Morrel, “if this be so, it must
      be a miracle of heaven! Impossible, impossible!”
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his
      hand, the acceptance receipted—the splendid diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, sir,” exclaimed Cocles, “what can it mean?—the
      <i>Pharaon</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, dear ones,” said Morrel, rising from his seat, “let
      us go and see, and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence!”
      They all went out, and on the stairs met Madame Morrel, who had been
      afraid to go up into the study. In a moment they were at the Canebière.
      There was a crowd on the pier. All the crowd gave way before Morrel.
      “The <i>Pharaon</i>, the <i>Pharaon</i>!” said every voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a ship
      bearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, “The <i>Pharaon</i>,
      Morrel &amp; Son, of Marseilles.” She was the exact duplicate of the
      other <i>Pharaon</i>, and loaded, as that had been, with cochineal and
      indigo. She cast anchor, clued up sails, and on the deck was Captain
      Gaumard giving orders, and good old Penelon making signals to M. Morrel.
      To doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of the senses,
      and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony. As Morrel
      and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and amid the
      applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with his face
      half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the sentry-box,
      watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low tone: “Be
      happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do
      hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds.”

    <p>
      And with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his hiding-place,
      and without being observed, descended one of the flights of steps provided
      for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted “Jacopo, Jacopo,
      Jacopo!” Then a launch came to shore, took him on board, and
      conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with
      the activity of a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who,
      weeping with joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd
      around him, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed
      to be seeking in the skies. “And now,” said the unknown,
      “farewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! Farewell to all the
      feelings that expand the heart! I have been heaven’s substitute to
      recompense the good—now the god of vengeance yields to me his power
      to punish the wicked!”
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal, the
      yacht instantly put out to sea.

    <h2>
      Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>owards the
      beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the first society
      of Paris, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz d’Epinay,
      were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year,
      and that Franz, who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy,
      should act as <i>cicerone</i> to Albert. As it is no inconsiderable affair
      to spend the Carnival at Rome, especially when you have no great desire to
      sleep on the Piazza del Popolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor
      Pastrini, the proprietor of the Hôtel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to
      reserve comfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that he
      had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at
      the low charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing
      to make the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.
      As for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few days
      in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or three
      evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a fancy into
      his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte) to
      visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that
      secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and lay
      down, and said to the crew,—“To the Island of Elba!” The
      boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz
      disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having
      followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and
      re-embarked for Marciana. Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa,
      where he was assured that red partridges abounded. The sport was bad;
      Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every
      unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper.
      “Ah, if your excellency chose,” said the captain, “you
      might have capital sport.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you see that island?” continued the captain, pointing to a
      conical pile rising from the indigo sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what is this island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Island of Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I have no permission to shoot over this island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is
      uninhabited.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed!” said the young man. “A desert island in
      the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not
      contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To whom does this island belong?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Tuscany.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What game shall I find there!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thousands of wild goats.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who live upon the stones, I suppose,” said Franz with an
      incredulous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the
      crevices of the rocks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where can I sleep?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if
      your excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like—we can
      sail as well by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our
      oars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not yet
      available, he accepted the proposition. Upon his answer in the
      affirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.
      “Well,” asked he, “what now? Is there any difficulty in
      the way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.” replied the captain, “but we must warn your
      excellency that the island is an infected port.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a
      refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and
      Africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have to
      perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deuce! That puts a different face on the matter. Six days! Why,
      that’s as long as the Almighty took to make the world! Too long a
      wait—too long.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I shall not,” cried Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nor I, nor I,” chorused the sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then steer for Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon
      sailing in the direction of the island. Franz waited until all was in
      order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken their
      places—three forward, and one at the helm—he resumed the
      conversation. “Gaetano,” said he to the captain, “you
      tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to
      me, a very different kind of game from the goats.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency, and it is true.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture
      of Algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in
      the romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits
      who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet,
      every day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome. Has not your excellency
      heard that the French <i>chargé d’affaires</i> was robbed six months
      ago within five hundred paces of Velletri?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, I heard that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you
      would hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an
      English yacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita
      Vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but,
      doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered. Now this rock it has met
      has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who have
      surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some desert
      and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a
      forest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom
      of the boat, “why do not those who have been plundered complain to
      the French, Sardinian, or Tuscan governments?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?” said Gaetano with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their
      own boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand
      and foot, they attach to everyone’s neck a four and twenty pound
      ball, a large hole is chopped in the vessel’s bottom, and then they
      leave her. At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and
      settle down. First one gun’l goes under, then the other. Then they
      lift and sink again, and both go under at once. All at once there’s
      a noise like a cannon—that’s the air blowing up the deck. Soon
      the water rushes out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the
      vessel gives a last groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming
      a vast whirlpool in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five
      minutes nothing but the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at
      the bottom of the sea. Do you understand now,” said the captain,
      “why no complaints are made to the government, and why the vessel
      never reaches port?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing the
      expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had started, he
      thought it would be cowardly to draw back. He was one of those men who do
      not rashly court danger, but if danger presents itself, combat it with the
      most unalterable coolness. Calm and resolute, he treated any peril as he
      would an adversary in a duel,—calculated its probable method of
      approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of strategy and not from
      cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack, and won victory at a
      single thrust. “Bah!” said he, “I have travelled through
      Sicily and Calabria—I have sailed two months in the Archipelago, and
      yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,”
      replied Gaetano, “but you questioned me, and I have answered; that’s
      all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to
      enjoy it as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and they
      were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near the
      island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that they
      could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like cannon
      balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices.
      As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was
      evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully watched the
      glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a few
      fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible. They were
      within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind
      Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their rugged
      peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant Adamastor, rose
      dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the light that gilded
      its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow. Little by little
      the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the
      expiring day; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain,
      where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest of a volcano, then gloom
      gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base, and the island
      now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker; half
      an hour after, the night was quite dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every
      rock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity Franz
      was not without uneasiness—Corsica had long since disappeared, and
      Monte Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the lynx,
      to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest
      hesitation. An hour had passed since the sun had set, when Franz fancied
      he saw, at a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but he could not
      precisely make out what it was, and fearing to excite the mirth of the
      sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land, he remained silent;
      suddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land might resemble a
      cloud, but the fire was not a meteor. “What is this light?”
      asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush!” said the captain; “it is a fire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you told me the island was uninhabited?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that
      it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And for pirates?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And for pirates,” returned Gaetano, repeating Franz’s
      words. “It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the
      island, for, as you see, the fire is behind us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But this fire?” continued Franz. “It seems to me rather
      reassuring than otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light
      a fire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that goes for nothing,” said Gaetano. “If you can
      guess the position of the island in the darkness, you will see that the
      fire cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant
      neighbors?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what we must find out,” returned Gaetano, fixing his
      eyes on this terrestrial star.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can you find out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You shall see.” Gaetano consulted with his companions, and
      after five minutes’ discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused
      the vessel to tack about, they returned the way they had come, and in a
      few minutes the fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land. The
      pilot again changed the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the
      island, and was soon within fifty paces of it. Gaetano lowered the sail,
      and the boat came to rest. All this was done in silence, and from the
      moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the responsibility
      on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him, while they got out
      their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away, which, thanks to
      the darkness, would not be difficult. As for Franz, he examined his arms
      with the utmost coolness; he had two double-barrelled guns and a rifle; he
      loaded them, looked at the priming, and waited quietly. During this time
      the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and secured his trousers
      round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no shoes and stockings to
      take off; after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips, and
      lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam towards the shore with
      such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound; he
      could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake. This track
      soon disappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore. Everyone
      on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same luminous
      track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board. “Well?”
      exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are Spanish smugglers,” said he; “they have with
      them two Corsican bandits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish
      smugglers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” returned the captain with an accent of the most
      profound pity, “we ought always to help one another. Very often the
      bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a
      vessel, and good fellows like us on board, they come and demand
      hospitality of us; you can’t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we
      receive them, and for greater security we stand out to sea. This costs us
      nothing, and saves the life, or at least the liberty, of a
      fellow-creature, who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing
      out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” said Franz, “then you are a smuggler occasionally,
      Gaetano?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency, we must live somehow,” returned the other,
      smiling impenetrably.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other
      by signs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But these two Corsican bandits?” said Franz, calculating the
      chances of peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the
      authorities.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not
      in a Corsican’s nature to revenge himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean by having made a stiff?—having assassinated
      a man?” said Franz, continuing his investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different
      thing,” returned the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said the young man, “let us demand hospitality
      of these smugglers and bandits. Do you think they will grant it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without doubt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How many are they?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Four, and the two bandits make six.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be
      able to hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due
      precautions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do
      more than permit, I exhort you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Silence, then!” said Gaetano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone obeyed. For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in its
      true light, it was a grave one. He was alone in the darkness with sailors
      whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to him; who knew
      that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who had often
      examined his weapons,—which were very beautiful,—if not with
      envy, at least with curiosity. On the other hand, he was about to land,
      without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed, a
      very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him
      much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits. The history of the
      scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day, seemed
      very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible sources of
      danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his hand. The sailors
      had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves.
      Through the darkness Franz, whose eyes were now more accustomed to it,
      could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing, and then, as
      they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire more brilliant than ever, and
      about it five or six persons seated. The blaze illumined the sea for a
      hundred paces around. Gaetano skirted the light, carefully keeping the
      boat in the shadow; then, when they were opposite the fire, he steered to
      the centre of the circle, singing a fishing song, of which his companions
      sung the chorus. At the first words of the song the men seated round the
      fire arose and approached the landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat,
      evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their
      intentions. They soon appeared satisfied and returned (with the exception
      of one, who remained at the shore) to their fire, at which the carcass of
      a goat was roasting. When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore,
      the man on the beach, who carried a carbine, presented arms after the
      manner of a sentinel, and cried, “Who comes there?” in
      Sardinian. Franz coolly cocked both barrels. Gaetano then exchanged a few
      words with this man which the traveller did not understand, but which
      evidently concerned him. “Will your excellency give your name, or
      remain <i>incognito</i>?” asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name must rest unknown,—merely say I am a Frenchman
      travelling for pleasure.” As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this
      answer, the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the
      fire, who rose and disappeared among the rocks. Not a word was spoken,
      everyone seemed occupied, Franz with his disembarkment, the sailors with
      their sails, the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this
      carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other. The
      man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by
      which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who,
      turning to the boat, said, “<i>S’accommodi</i>.” The
      Italian <i>s’accommodi</i> is untranslatable; it means at once,
      “Come, enter, you are welcome; make yourself at home; you are the
      master.” It is like that Turkish phrase of Molière’s that so
      astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its
      utterance. The sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes
      of the oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few
      words with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came
      Franz. One of his guns was swung over his shoulder, Gaetano had the other,
      and a sailor held his rifle; his dress, half artist, half dandy, did not
      excite any suspicion, and, consequently, no disquietude. The boat was
      moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable
      bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who
      filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out, “Not that way, if you
      please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while two
      sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way. They
      advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade
      surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike
      sentry-boxes. Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks
      and thick bushes of myrtles. Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass of
      cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this
      retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the wandering
      visitors of Monte Cristo. As for his suspicions, once on <i>terra firma</i>,
      once that he had seen the indifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his
      hosts, his anxiety had quite disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat,
      had turned to appetite. He mentioned this to Gaetano, who replied that
      nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their
      boat, bread, wine, half a dozen partridges, and a good fire to roast them
      by. “Besides,” added he, “if the smell of their roast
      meat tempts you, I will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are a born diplomat,” returned Franz; “go and try.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which
      they made a fire. Franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of the
      roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Franz, “anything new?—do they refuse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary,” returned Gaetano, “the chief, who was
      told you were a young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” observed Franz, “this chief is very polite, and
      I see no objection—the more so as I bring my share of the supper.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he
      makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive you
      at his house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His house? Has he built one here, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know this chief, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have heard talk of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Favorably or otherwise?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Both.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deuce!—and what is this condition?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he
      himself bids you.” Franz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible,
      what he thought of this proposal. “Ah,” replied he, guessing
      Franz’s thought, “I know this is a serious matter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What should you do in my place?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I, who have nothing to lose,—I should go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You would accept?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, were it only out of curiosity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Listen,” said Gaetano, lowering his voice, “I do not
      know if what they say is true”—he stopped to see if anyone was
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do they say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is
      nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What nonsense!” said Franz, reseating himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is no nonsense; it is quite true. Cama, the pilot of the <i>Saint
      Ferdinand</i>, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such
      treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know,” observed Franz, “that with such stories
      you make me think of Ali Baba’s enchanted cavern?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I tell you what I have been told.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you advise me to accept?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I don’t say that; your excellency will do as you please;
      I should be sorry to advise you in the matter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz pondered the matter for a few moments, concluded that a man so rich
      could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had, and
      seeing only the prospect of a good supper, accepted. Gaetano departed with
      the reply. Franz was prudent, and wished to learn all he possibly could
      concerning his host. He turned towards the sailor, who, during this
      dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man
      proud of his office, and asked him how these men had landed, as no vessel
      of any kind was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind that,” returned the sailor, “I know their
      vessel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it a very beautiful vessel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would not wish for a better to sail round the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of what burden is she?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “About a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather. She is
      what the English call a yacht.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where was she built?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know not; but my own opinion is she is a Genoese.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how did a leader of smugglers,” continued Franz, “venture
      to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not say that the owner was a smuggler,” replied the
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; but Gaetano did, I thought.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then
      spoken to anyone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” thought Franz, “he is still more mysterious,
      since the two accounts do not agree.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is his name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you ask him, he says Sinbad the Sailor; but I doubt if it be his
      real name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sinbad the Sailor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where does he reside?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What country does he come from?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you ever seen him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sometimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What sort of a man is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency will judge for yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where will he receive me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found
      this island deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto
      all over, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening; they
      say that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Decidedly,” muttered Franz, “this is an Arabian Nights’
      adventure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His excellency waits for you,” said a voice, which he
      recognized as that of the sentinel. He was accompanied by two of the yacht’s
      crew. Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the
      man who had spoken to him. Without uttering a word, they bandaged his eyes
      with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some
      indiscretion. Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the
      least attempt to raise the bandage. He promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and
      preceded by the sentinel. After going about thirty paces, he smelt the
      appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was
      passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther,
      evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not
      allow Gaetano to go—a refusal he could now comprehend. Presently, by
      a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were entering a cave; after
      going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling, and it seemed to him
      as though the atmosphere again changed, and became balmy and perfumed. At
      length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet, and his guides let go
      their hold of him. There was a moment’s silence, and then a voice,
      in excellent French, although, with a foreign accent, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      “Welcome, sir. I beg you will remove your bandage.” It may be
      supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission,
      but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the presence of a man
      from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a Tunisian costume,
      that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk tassel, a vest of black
      cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep red, large and full
      gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold like the vest, and yellow
      slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist, and a small sharp
      and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably
      handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite
      straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek type,
      while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by the
      black moustache that encircled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had been
      long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue
      of life. He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made, and, like
      the men of the south, had small hands and feet. But what astonished Franz,
      who had treated Gaetano’s description as a fable, was the splendor
      of the apartment in which he found himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers of
      gold. In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of Arabian
      swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with gems; from
      the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful shape and color,
      while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which they sunk to the
      instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered, and also
      in front of another door, leading into a second apartment which seemed to
      be brilliantly illuminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise, and, moreover,
      returned look for look, not even taking his eyes off him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” he said, after a pause, “a thousand excuses for
      the precaution taken in your introduction hither; but as, during the
      greater portion of the year, this island is deserted, if the secret of
      this abode were discovered. I should doubtless, find on my return my
      temporary retirement in a state of great disorder, which would be
      exceedingly annoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because I
      should not have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all
      the rest of mankind at pleasure. Let me now endeavor to make you forget
      this temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not
      expect to find here—that is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty
      comfortable beds.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, my dear sir,” replied Franz, “make no
      apologies. I have always observed that they bandage people’s eyes
      who penetrate enchanted palaces, for instance, those of Raoul in the <i>Huguenots</i>,
      and really I have nothing to complain of, for what I see makes me think of
      the wonders of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.”

      “Alas! I may say with Lucullus, if I could have anticipated the
      honor of your visit, I would have prepared for it. But such as is my
      hermitage, it is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to
      share, if you will. Ali, is the supper ready?”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony, and
      dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all was
      prepared in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said the unknown to Franz, “I do not know if you
      are of my opinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two
      or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to
      address one another. Pray observe, that I too much respect the laws of
      hospitality to ask your name or title. I only request you to give me one
      by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you. As for myself, that I
      may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called ‘Sinbad
      the Sailor.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I,” replied Franz, “will tell you, as I only
      require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see
      no reason why at this moment I should not be called Aladdin. That will
      keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have
      been conveyed by some good genius.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, Signor Aladdin,” replied the singular Amphitryon,
      “you heard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to
      enter the dining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest.
      Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was
      splendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast his
      eyes around him. The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room
      he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique bas-reliefs of
      priceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment, which was
      oblong, were four magnificent statues, having baskets in their hands.
      These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit; there were
      Sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from Malaga, oranges from the Balearic
      Isles, peaches from France, and dates from Tunis. The supper consisted of
      a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican blackbirds; a boar’s ham
      with jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce, a glorious turbot, and a
      gigantic lobster. Between these large dishes were smaller ones containing
      various dainties. The dishes were of silver, and the plates of Japanese
      china.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a
      dream. Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so
      admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with
      much ease and grace—“yes, he is a poor devil who is much
      devoted to me, and does all he can to prove it. He remembers that I saved
      his life, and as he has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude
      towards me for having kept it on his shoulders.” Ali approached his
      master, took his hand, and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,” said Franz, “to
      ask you the particulars of this kindness?”

      “Oh, they are simple enough,” replied the host. “It
      seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey
      of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned
      by the Bey to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the
      tongue the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. I
      always had a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his
      tongue was cut out, I went to the Bey, and proposed to give him for Ali a
      splendid double-barreled gun, which I knew he was very desirous of having.
      He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil’s
      punishment. But when I added to the gun an English cutlass with which I
      had shivered his highness’s yataghan to pieces, the Bey yielded, and
      agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that the poor fellow
      never again set foot in Tunis. This was a useless clause in the bargain,
      for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of Africa, he
      runs down below, and can only be induced to appear again when we are out
      of sight of that quarter of the globe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to think
      of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related the brief
      narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,”
      he said, by way of changing the conversation, “you pass your life in
      travelling?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be
      able to accomplish it,” said the unknown with a singular smile;
      “and I made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due
      season.” Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness,
      his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have suffered a great deal, sir?” said Franz inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, “What makes
      you suppose so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything,” answered Franz,—“your voice, your
      look, your pallid complexion, and even the life you lead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?—I live the happiest life possible, the real life of a
      pasha. I am king of all creation. I am pleased with one place, and stay
      there; I get tired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings
      like one; my attendants obey my slightest wish. Sometimes I amuse myself
      by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law. Then I
      have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or
      appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees. Ah, if you had
      tasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never return to
      the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Revenge, for instance!” observed Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into
      the depth of the heart and thoughts. “And why revenge?” he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because,” replied Franz, “you seem to me like a man
      who, persecuted by society, has a fearful account to settle with it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh,
      which displayed his white and sharp teeth. “You have not guessed
      rightly. Such as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day
      perhaps I shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the little man
      in the blue cloak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And will that be the first time you ever took that journey?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; it will. I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure
      you that it is not my fault I have delayed it so long—it will happen
      one day or the other.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain
      arrangements.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should like to be there at the time you come, and I will endeavor
      to repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality
      displayed to me at Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,” replied
      the host, “but, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all
      probability, <i>incognito</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz, for the
      unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to
      which his guest did ample justice. Then Ali brought on the dessert, or
      rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on
      the table. Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a
      silver cover. The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused
      Franz’s curiosity. He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish
      paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly unknown
      to him. He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup contained as he
      was before he had looked at it, and then casting his eyes towards his host
      he saw him smile at his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You cannot guess,” said he, “what there is in that
      small vase, can you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I really cannot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia
      which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” replied Franz, “this ambrosia, no doubt, in
      passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed
      a human name; in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for
      which, to tell the truth, I do not feel any particular desire?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,” cried
      Sinbad; “we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing,
      without regarding it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without
      recognizing it. Are you a man for the substantials, and is gold your god?
      taste this, and the mines of Peru, Guzerat, and Golconda are opened to
      you. Are you a man of imagination—a poet? taste this, and the
      boundaries of possibility disappear; the fields of infinite space open to
      you, you advance free in heart, free in mind, into the boundless realms of
      unfettered reverie. Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the
      greatnesses of the earth? taste this, and in an hour you will be a king,
      not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe like France,
      Spain, or England, but king of the world, king of the universe, king of
      creation; without bowing at the feet of Satan, you will be king and master
      of all the kingdoms of the earth. Is it not tempting what I offer you, and
      is it not an easy thing, since it is only to do thus? look!”
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so
      lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his lips,
      and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent
      backwards. Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite
      sweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired, “What, then, is
      this precious stuff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you ever hear,” he replied, “of the Old Man of the
      Mountain, who attempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course I have.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by
      the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name. In this valley were
      magnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens
      isolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and there,
      says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which transported them
      to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs, ever-ripe fruit, and
      ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took for reality was but a
      dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous, so enthralling, that
      they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them, and
      obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck down the designated
      victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing that the death they
      underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the
      holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight foretaste.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” cried Franz, “it is hashish! I know that—by
      name at least.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashish—the
      purest and most unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,—the hashish of
      Abou-Gor, the celebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should
      be built a palace, inscribed with these words, <i>A grateful world to the
      dealer in happiness</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know,” said Franz, “I have a very great
      inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your
      eulogies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Judge for yourself, Signor Aladdin—judge, but do not confine
      yourself to one trial. Like everything else, we must habituate the senses
      to a fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a
      struggle in nature against this divine substance,—in nature which is
      not made for joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the
      combat, the dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns
      supreme, then the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what
      changes occur! It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the
      joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer,
      but to dream thus forever. When you return to this mundane sphere from
      your visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a
      Lapland winter—to quit paradise for earth—heaven for hell!
      Taste the hashish, guest of mine—taste the hashish.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz’s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous
      preparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift it
      to his mouth. “<i>Diable!</i>” he said, after having swallowed
      the divine preserve. “I do not know if the result will be as
      agreeable as you describe, but the thing does not appear to me as
      palatable as you say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of
      the substances it flavors. Tell me, the first time you tasted oysters,
      tea, porter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did
      you like them? Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants
      with assafœtida, and the Chinese eat swallows’ nests? Eh? no! Well,
      it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world
      will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears to
      you flat and distasteful. Let us now go into the adjoining chamber, which
      is your apartment, and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They both arose, and while he who called himself Sinbad—and whom we
      have occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some title
      by which to distinguish him—gave some orders to the servant, Franz
      entered still another apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was simply yet richly furnished. It was round, and a large divan
      completely encircled it. Divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered
      with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there
      were heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas, striped tiger-skins from Bengal;
      panther-skins from the Cape, spotted beautifully, like those that appeared
      to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia, fox-skins from Norway, and so on; and
      all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other, so that it
      seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or reclining on the most
      luxurious bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes and
      amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there was no
      need to smoke the same pipe twice. Each of them took one, which Ali
      lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment’s silence, during which Sinbad gave himself up to
      thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of his
      conversation; and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie, into which
      we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems to remove with
      its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the smoker in exchange
      all the visions of the soul. Ali brought in the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do you take it?” inquired the unknown; “in the
      French or Turkish style, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling?
      As you please; it is ready in all ways.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will take it in the Turkish style,” replied Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you are right,” said his host; “it shows you have a
      tendency for an Oriental life. Ah, those Orientals; they are the only men
      who know how to live. As for me,” he added, with one of those
      singular smiles which did not escape the young man, “when I have
      completed my affairs in Paris, I shall go and die in the East; and should
      you wish to see me again, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.”

    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>,” said Franz, “it would be the easiest
      thing in the world; for I feel eagle’s wings springing out at my
      shoulders, and with those wings I could make a tour of the world in four
      and twenty hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work. Well, unfurl your
      wings, and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch
      over you; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we
      are here to ease your fall.” He then said something in Arabic to
      Ali, who made a sign of obedience and withdrew, but not to any distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him. All the
      bodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the events
      of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the first
      approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of
      the coming of slumber. His body seemed to acquire an airy lightness, his
      perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses seemed to
      redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it was not the
      gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before he slept, but
      a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue of the ocean,
      all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the summer breeze; then,
      in the midst of the songs of his sailors,—songs so clear and
      sonorous, that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been
      taken down,—he saw the Island of Monte Cristo, no longer as a
      threatening rock in the midst of the waves, but as an oasis in the desert;
      then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an enchanting
      and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some Loreley had decreed to
      attract a soul thither, or Amphion, the enchanter, intended there to build
      a city.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock,
      as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of
      most delicious melody. He descended, or rather seemed to descend, several
      steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be supposed
      to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from such perfumes as set the
      mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and he saw again
      all he had seen before his sleep, from Sinbad, his singular host, to Ali,
      the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and become confused
      before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is
      extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of statues, lighted only by
      one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night
      over the sleep of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with
      eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair. They
      were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated courtesans. Then
      among them glided like a pure ray, like a Christian angel in the midst of
      Olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm shadows, those soft
      visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and
      approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in their
      long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves, and
      assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints
      withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the
      serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that held him
      in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him
      saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream of
      passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect. Lips of stone
      turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to Franz,
      yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a sorrow and
      voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty
      lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces. The more he strove
      against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall,
      and at length, weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul, he gave way
      and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble
      goddesses, and the enchantment of his marvellous dream.

      Chapter 32. The Waking
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Franz returned
      to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream. He thought himself in a
      sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated. He
      stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he rose to his seat, and
      found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather, very soft and
      odoriferous. The vision had fled; and as if the statues had been but
      shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at his waking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and to
      all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality. He
      found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through a
      kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky. The air and water were
      shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors were
      sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the boat was at
      anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow,
      and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left against the
      rocks a lace of foam as white as silver. He was for some time without
      reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of
      nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this view of the
      outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him of the illusiveness
      of his vision, and once more awakened memory. He recalled his arrival on
      the island, his presentation to a smuggler chief, a subterranean palace
      full of splendor, an excellent supper, and a spoonful of hashish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, however, even in the very face of open day, that at least a
      year had elapsed since all these things had passed, so deep was the
      impression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong a hold had it
      taken of his imagination. Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the
      sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the shadows
      which had shared his dream with looks and kisses. Otherwise, his head was
      perfectly clear, and his body refreshed; he was free from the slightest
      headache; on the contrary, he felt a certain degree of lightness, a
      faculty for absorbing the pure air, and enjoying the bright sunshine more
      vividly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived him;
      and the patron, accosting him, said, “The Signor Sinbad has left his
      compliments for your excellency, and desires us to express the regret he
      feels at not being able to take his leave in person; but he trusts you
      will excuse him, as very important business calls him to Malaga.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, then, Gaetano,” said Franz, “this is, then, all
      reality; there exists a man who has received me in this island,
      entertained me right royally, and has departed while I was asleep?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all
      her sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all
      probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was
      making sail towards the southern point of Corsica. Franz adjusted his
      telescope, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken. At
      the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the
      shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he had been
      on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to his guest in
      token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as
      an exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud of smoke was seen
      at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as it expanded in the
      air, and then Franz heard a slight report.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, do you hear?” observed Gaetano; “he is bidding
      you adieu.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any
      idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the
      yacht from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are your excellency’s orders?” inquired Gaetano.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the first place, light me a torch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes, I understand,” replied the patron, “to find
      the entrance to the enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your
      excellency, if it would amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask
      for. But I too have had the idea you have, and two or three times the same
      fancy has come over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a
      torch,” he added, “and give it to his excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Giovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean grotto,
      followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had awaked by the
      bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he carried his
      torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw nothing, unless
      that, by traces of smoke, others had before him attempted the same thing,
      and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall,
      as impenetrable as futurity, without strict scrutiny; he did not see a
      fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it, or a
      projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would
      give way. All was vain; and he lost two hours in his attempts, which were
      at last utterly useless. At the end of this time he gave up his search,
      and Gaetano smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a small
      white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass, but even
      then he could not distinguish anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats,
      which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and began to
      hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty,
      rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he
      had killed a goat and two kids. These animals, though wild and agile as
      chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz could not consider
      them as game. Moreover, other ideas, much more enthralling, occupied his
      mind. Since, the evening before, he had really been the hero of one of the
      tales of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>, and he was irresistibly
      attracted towards the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second,
      after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The second visit
      was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast
      ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening
      when his mysterious host had invited him to supper; and he saw the little
      yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave, continuing her flight towards
      Corsica.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” he remarked to Gaetano, “you told me that Signor
      Sinbad was going to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of
      Porto-Vecchio.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t you remember,” said the patron, “I told you
      that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True; and he is going to land them,” added Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely so,” replied Gaetano. “Ah, he is one who
      fears neither God nor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty
      leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service.”

    <p>
      “But such services as these might involve him with the authorities
      of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,”
      said Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what cares he for that,” replied Gaetano with a laugh,
      “or any authorities? He smiles at them. Let them try to pursue him!
      Why, in the first place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would
      beat any frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw
      himself on the coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends
      everywhere?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franz’s host, had the
      honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the
      whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional privileges.
      As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Cristo. He
      had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto; he consequently
      despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being ready, he hastened on board,
      and they were soon under way. At the moment the boat began her course they
      lost sight of the yacht, as it disappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio.
      With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then
      supper, Sinbad, hashish, statues,—all became a dream for Franz. The
      boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the sun rose,
      they had lost sight of Monte Cristo. When Franz had once again set foot on
      shore, he forgot, for the moment at least, the events which had just
      passed, while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then
      thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion, who was
      awaiting him at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by
      the mail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained
      beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini’s hotel.
      But this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with
      people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which
      precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great events in
      every year,—the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast
      of St. Peter. All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull
      apathy, between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of
      station between this world and the next—a sublime spot, a
      resting-place full of poetry and character, and at which Franz had already
      halted five or six times, and at each time found it more marvellous and
      striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he made his way through the mob, which was continually increasing
      and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel. On his first
      inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to hired
      hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that there was no
      room for him at the Hôtel de Londres. Then he sent his card to Signor
      Pastrini, and asked for Albert de Morcerf. This plan succeeded; and Signor
      Pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for having made his
      excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the candlestick from the
      porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him
      to Albert, when Morcerf himself appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor. The two rooms
      looked onto the street—a fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon
      as an inappreciable advantage. The rest of the floor was hired by a very
      rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the host
      was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged.
      “Very good, signor Pastrini,” said Franz; “but we must
      have some supper instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following
      days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As to supper,” replied the landlord, “you shall be
      served immediately; but as for the carriage——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What as to the carriage?” exclaimed Albert. “Come,
      come, Signor Pastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” replied the host, “we will do all in our power to
      procure you one—this is all I can say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when shall we know?” inquired Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tomorrow morning,” answered the innkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, the deuce! then we shall pay the more, that’s all, I see
      plainly enough. At Drake’s or Aaron’s one pays twenty-five
      lire for common days, and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for
      Sundays and feast days; add five lire a day more for extras, that will
      make forty, and there’s an end of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a
      carriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then they must put horses to mine. It is a little worse for the
      journey, but that’s no matter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are no horses.” Albert looked at Franz like a man who
      hears a reply he does not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you understand that, my dear Franz—no horses?” he
      said, “but can’t we have post-horses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left
      but those absolutely requisite for posting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are we to say to this?” asked Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, I
      am accustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another. Is
      supper ready, Signor Pastrini?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, let us sup.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the carriage and horses?” said Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a
      question of how much shall be charged for them.” Morcerf then, with
      that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a
      full purse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept soundly,
      and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with
      six horses.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next morning
      Franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell. The sound had not yet died
      away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, excellency,” said the landlord triumphantly, and
      without waiting for Franz to question him, “I feared yesterday, when
      I would not promise you anything, that you were too late—there is
      not a single carriage to be had—that is, for the last three days of
      the carnival.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” returned Franz, “for the very three days it is
      most needed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the matter?” said Albert, entering; “no
      carriage to be had?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just so,” returned Franz, “you have guessed it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is to say, excellency,” replied Pastrini, who was
      desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world
      in the eyes of his guest, “that there are no carriages to be had
      from Sunday to Tuesday evening, but from now till Sunday you can have
      fifty if you please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is something,” said Albert; “today is
      Thursday, and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,” replied
      Franz, “which will make it still more difficult.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” said Morcerf, “let us enjoy the present
      without gloomy forebodings for the future.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least we can have a window?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the Corso.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, a window!” exclaimed Signor Pastrini,—“utterly
      impossible; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria
      Palace, and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a
      day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Franz to Albert, “do you know what is the
      best thing we can do? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are
      sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, the devil, no,” cried Albert; “I came to Rome to
      see the Carnival, and I will, though I see it on stilts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster
      pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete
      success.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday
      morning?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Parbleu!</i>” said Albert, “do you think we are
      going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome, like lawyers’
      clerks?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hasten to comply with your excellencies’ wishes; only, I
      tell you beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next
      apartments,” said Franz, “I warn you, that as I have been four
      times before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give
      you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you
      will make a good profit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, excellency”—said Pastrini, still striving to gain
      his point.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now go,” returned Franz, “or I shall go myself and
      bargain with your <i>affettatore</i>, who is mine also; he is an old
      friend of mine, who has plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope
      of making more out of me, he will take a less price than the one I offer
      you; you will lose the preference, and that will be your fault.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,” returned
      Signor Pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he
      confesses defeat; “I will do all I can, and I hope you will be
      satisfied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now we understand each other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When do you wish the carriage to be here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In an hour it will be at the door.”
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance which
      was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion,
      but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have thought
      themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the
      Carnival. “Excellency,” cried the <i>cicerone</i>, seeing
      Franz approach the window, “shall I bring the carriage nearer to the
      palace?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse was
      to look round him, but these words were addressed to him. Franz was the
      “excellency,” the vehicle was the “carriage,” and
      the Hôtel de Londres was the “palace.” The genius for
      laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their
      excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the <i>cicerone</i>
      sprang into the seat behind. “Where do your excellencies wish to go?”
      asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Saint Peter’s first, and then to the Colosseum,”
      returned Albert. But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint
      Peter’s, and a month to study it. The day was passed at Saint Peter’s
      alone. Suddenly the daylight began to fade away; Franz took out his watch—it
      was half-past four. They returned to the hotel; at the door Franz ordered
      the coachman to be ready at eight. He wished to show Albert the Colosseum
      by moonlight, as he had shown him Saint Peter’s by daylight. When we
      show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same pride as
      when we point out a woman whose lover we have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, skirt the outer wall,
      and re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni; thus they would behold the
      Colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the
      Capitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimus Severus, the Temple of Antoninus
      and Faustina, and the Via Sacra.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down to dinner. Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet; he
      gave them a tolerable repast. At the end of the dinner he entered in
      person. Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised, and began
      accordingly, but at the first words he was interrupted. “Excellency,”
      said Pastrini, “I am delighted to have your approbation, but it was
      not for that I came.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?” asked
      Albert, lighting his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any
      longer; at Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything
      cannot be done, there is an end of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is much more convenient at Paris,—when anything cannot be
      done, you pay double, and it is done directly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what all the French say,” returned Signor Pastrini,
      somewhat piqued; “for that reason, I do not understand why they
      travel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing
      his chair on its hind legs, “only madmen, or blockheads like us,
      ever do travel. Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du
      Helder, their walk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the Café de Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street,
      appeared every day on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the
      only restaurant where you can really dine, that is, if you are on good
      terms with its waiters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he was
      musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear. “But,”
      said Franz, in his turn interrupting his host’s meditations, “you
      had some motive for coming here, may I beg to know what it was?”

    </p>
    <p>
      “You intend visiting <i>Il Colosseo</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You mean the Colosseum?”

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      “Dangerous!—and why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On account of the famous Luigi Vampa.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray, who may this famous Luigi Vampa be?” inquired Albert;
      “he may be very famous at Rome, but I can assure you he is quite
      unknown at Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What! do you not know him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have not that honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have never heard his name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the
      Gasparones were mere children.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now then, Albert,” cried Franz, “here is a bandit for
      you at last.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I forewarn you, Signor Pastrini, that I shall not believe one word
      of what you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin. ‘Once
      upon a time——’ Well, go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him the more reasonable
      of the two; we must do him justice,—he had had a great many
      Frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.
      “Excellency,” said he gravely, addressing Franz, “if you
      look upon me as a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for
      your interest I——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Albert does not say you are a liar, Signor Pastrini,” said
      Franz, “but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us,—but
      I will believe all you say; so proceed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if your excellency doubt my veracity——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Signor Pastrini,” returned Franz, “you are more
      susceptible than Cassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed
      her; while you, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience.
      Come, sit down, and tell us all about this Signor Vampa.”

      “This,” replied Signor Pastrini, “that you will go out
      by one, but I very much doubt your returning by the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?” asked Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the
      gates.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On your honor is that true?” cried Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count,” returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albert’s
      repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions, “I do not say this
      to you, but to your companion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these
      things are not to be laughed at.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow,” said Albert, turning to Franz, “here
      is an admirable adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols,
      blunderbusses, and double-barrelled guns. Luigi Vampa comes to take us,
      and we take him—we bring him back to Rome, and present him to his
      holiness the Pope, who asks how he can repay so great a service; then we
      merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in
      the carriage, and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol,
      and proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their
      country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini’s face assumed
      an expression impossible to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And pray,” asked Franz, “where are these pistols,
      blunderbusses, and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the
      carriage?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my
      hunting-knife. And you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know, Signor Pastrini,” said Albert, lighting a second
      cigar at the first, “that this practice is very convenient for
      bandits, and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.”
      Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he only
      answered half the question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the only one
      likely to listen with attention. “Your excellency knows that it is
      not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What!” cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of
      being plundered tamely, “not make any resistance!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, for it would be useless. What could you do against a dozen
      bandits who spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their
      pieces at you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eh, <i>parbleu!</i>—they should kill me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, “Your
      friend is decidedly mad.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Albert,” returned Franz, “your answer is
      sublime, and worthy the ‘<i>Let him die</i>,’ of Corneille,
      only, when Horace made that answer, the safety of Rome was concerned; but,
      as for us, it is only to gratify a whim, and it would be ridiculous to
      risk our lives for so foolish a motive.” Albert poured himself out a
      glass of <i>lacryma Christi</i>, which he sipped at intervals, muttering
      some unintelligible words.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “now that my
      companion is quieted, and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are,
      tell me who is this Luigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?—young
      or old?—tall or short? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him
      by chance, like Jean Sbogar or Lara, we may recognize him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all
      these points, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell
      into his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,
      recollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a
      present of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us see the watch,” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet, bearing the name
      of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count’s coronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here it is,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Peste!</i>” returned Albert, “I compliment you on
      it; I have its fellow”—he took his watch from his waistcoat
      pocket—“and it cost me 3,000 francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us hear the history,” said Franz, motioning Signor
      Pastrini to seat himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellencies permit it?” asked the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu!</i>” cried Albert, “you are not a preacher,
      to remain standing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow, which
      meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning
      Luigi Vampa. “You tell me,” said Franz, at the moment Signor
      Pastrini was about to open his mouth, “that you knew Luigi Vampa
      when he was a child—he is still a young man, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A young man? he is only two and twenty;—he will gain himself
      a reputation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you think of that, Albert?—at two and twenty to be
      thus famous?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and at his age, Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon, who have all
      made some noise in the world, were quite behind him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So,” continued Franz, “the hero of this history is only
      two and twenty?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Scarcely so much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is he tall or short?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of the middle height—about the same stature as his
      excellency,” returned the host, pointing to Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks for the comparison,” said Albert, with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, Signor Pastrini,” continued Franz, smiling at his
      friend’s susceptibility. “To what class of society does he
      belong?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of
      San-Felice, situated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born
      at Pampinara, and entered the count’s service when he was five years
      old; his father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by
      the wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the
      little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he
      was seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to be
      taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his
      flock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet
      too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was called
      Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and that then
      he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be short, and that
      he must profit as much as possible by it. The child accepted joyfully.
      Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from
      Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o’clock in the morning, the
      priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and the little
      shepherd took his lesson out of the priest’s breviary. At the end of
      three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he must now
      learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make three
      alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out to
      him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a
      slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the flock was safe
      at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina, took a
      large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a sort of stylus. The next
      morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began. At the end of
      three months he had learned to write. The curate, astonished at his
      quickness and intelligence, made him a present of pens, paper, and a
      penknife. This demanded new effort, but nothing compared to the first; at
      the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus. The
      curate related the incident to the Count of San-Felice, who sent for the
      little shepherd, made him read and write before him, ordered his attendant
      to let him eat with the domestics, and to give him two piastres a month.
      With this, Luigi purchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative
      powers to everything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate
      sheep, houses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all
      sorts of objects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor,
      had commenced.

    <p>
      “A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended
      sheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone and
      was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other, let
      their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed together; in
      the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock from
      those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their respective
      farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they kept their
      word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and Teresa eleven.
      And yet their natural disposition revealed itself. Beside his taste for
      the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude,
      he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm, was often
      angry and capricious, and always sarcastic. None of the lads of Pampinara,
      Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or
      even to become his companion. His disposition (always inclined to exact
      concessions rather than to make them) kept him aloof from all friendships.
      Teresa alone ruled by a look, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character,
      which yielded beneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a
      man might have broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively
      and gay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received
      every month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of
      all the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in
      ear-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her friend’s
      generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired peasant
      near Rome. The two children grew up together, passing all their time with
      each other, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different
      characters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their
      conversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an
      army, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly
      attired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they
      had thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated
      their flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the
      reality of their humble position.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he
      had seen a wolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his
      flock. The steward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This
      gun had an excellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the
      precision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock, and
      had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a sculptor like
      Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what change it would
      require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a fresh stock, so
      beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres,
      had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be farther from his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For a long time a gun had been the young man’s greatest
      ambition. In every country where independence has taken the place of
      liberty, the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which
      at once renders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its
      owner terrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all
      his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon;
      he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a mark—the
      trunk of some old and moss-grown olivetree, that grew on the Sabine
      mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion;
      the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon became so
      expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report,
      and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased,
      with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.

    <p>
      “One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were
      usually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was
      dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders,
      and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi considerable
      reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds admirers, go where
      he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the strongest, and the most
      courageous <i>contadino</i> for ten leagues around; and although Teresa
      was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the Sabines, no
      one had ever spoken to her of love, because it was known that she was
      beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people had never declared their
      affection; they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled,
      whose branches intertwined, and whose intermingled perfume rises to the
      heavens. Only their wish to see each other had become a necessity, and
      they would have preferred death to a day’s separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of
      brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be
      much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from the
      neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief
      presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the
      kingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed the
      Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the Amasine
      between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of followers, and
      followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom he hoped to
      surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and Pampinara had
      disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much disquietude; but it
      was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto. After some time Cucumetto
      became the object of universal attention; the most extraordinary traits of
      ferocious daring and brutality were related of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of
      Frosinone. The bandit’s laws are positive; a young girl belongs
      first to him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she
      is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When
      their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is sent
      to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger;
      should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably lost. The young
      girl’s lover was in Cucumetto’s troop; his name was Carlini.
      When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms to him, and
      believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for he but too
      well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a favorite with
      Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served him, and as he had
      saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down, he
      hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took Cucumetto one side, while
      the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre
      of the forest, made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to hide her face
      from the lascivious gaze of the bandits. There he told the chief all—his
      affection for the prisoner, their promises of mutual fidelity, and how
      every night, since he had been near, they had met in some neighboring
      ruins.

    <p>
      “It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a
      village, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.
      Cucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had
      carried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception in
      Rita’s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.
      Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend’s entreaties, and bade him
      find a shepherd to send to Rita’s father at Frosinone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and
      bidding her write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that
      her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours’ delay
      was all that was granted—that is, until nine the next morning. The
      instant the letter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the
      plain to find a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock.
      The natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between
      the city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy
      undertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an
      hour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the
      joyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the
      provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye vainly
      sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of
      laughter. A cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on
      end. He repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a
      glass filled with Orvietto, saying, ‘To the health of the brave
      Cucumetto and the fair Rita.’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman’s
      cry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face of
      him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came.
      After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he found Rita
      senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini, Cucumetto
      rose, a pistol in each hand. The two brigands looked at each other for a
      moment—the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips, the other
      with the pallor of death on his brow. A terrible battle between the two
      men seemed imminent; but by degrees Carlini’s features relaxed, his
      hand, which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt, fell to his side.
      Rita lay between them. The moon lighted the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Well,’ said Cucumetto, ‘have you executed your
      commission?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes, captain,’ returned Carlini. ‘At nine o’clock
      tomorrow Rita’s father will be here with the money.’—‘It
      is well; in the meantime, we will have a merry night; this young girl is
      charming, and does credit to your taste. Now, as I am not egotistical, we
      will return to our comrades and draw lots for her.’—‘You
      have determined, then, to abandon her to the common law?’ said
      Carlini.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Why should an exception be made in her favor?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I thought that my entreaties——’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘What right have you, any more than the rest, to ask for an
      exception?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘It is true.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘But never mind,’ continued Cucumetto, laughing,
      ‘sooner or later your turn will come.’ Carlini’s teeth
      clenched convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Now, then,’ said Cucumetto, advancing towards the
      other bandits, ‘are you coming?’

      “Cucumetto departed, without losing sight of Carlini, for,
      doubtless, he feared lest he should strike him unawares; but nothing
      betrayed a hostile design on Carlini’s part. He was standing, his
      arms folded, near Rita, who was still insensible. Cucumetto fancied for a
      moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly; but this
      mattered little to him now Rita had been his; and as for the money, three
      hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he
      cared little about it. He continued to follow the path to the glade; but,
      to his great surprise, Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself. ‘Let
      us draw lots! let us draw lots!’ cried all the brigands, when they
      saw the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Their demand was fair, and the chief inclined his head in sign of
      acquiescence. The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand,
      and the red light of the fire made them look like demons. The names of
      all, including Carlini, were placed in a hat, and the youngest of the band
      drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio. He was the
      man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief, and to whom
      Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face. A large wound,
      extending from the temple to the mouth, was bleeding profusely.
      Diavolaccio, seeing himself thus favored by fortune, burst into a loud
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Captain,’ said he, ‘just now Carlini would not
      drink your health when I proposed it to him; propose mine to him, and let
      us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me.’ Everyone
      expected an explosion on Carlini’s part; but to their great
      surprise, he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other, and
      filling it,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Your health, Diavolaccio,’ said he calmly, and he
      drank it off, without his hand trembling in the least. Then sitting down
      by the fire, ‘My supper,’ said he; ‘my expedition has
      given me an appetite.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Well done, Carlini!’ cried the brigands; ‘that
      is acting like a good fellow;’ and they all formed a circle round
      the fire, while Diavolaccio disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened. The bandits
      looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard
      footsteps. They turned round, and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young girl
      in his arms. Her head hung back, and her long hair swept the ground. As
      they entered the circle, the bandits could perceive, by the firelight, the
      unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio. This apparition was
      so strange and so solemn, that everyone rose, with the exception of
      Carlini, who remained seated, and ate and drank calmly. Diavolaccio
      advanced amidst the most profound silence, and laid Rita at the captain’s
      feet. Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in
      the young girl and the bandit. A knife was plunged up to the hilt in Rita’s
      left breast. Everyone looked at Carlini; the sheath at his belt was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Ah, ah,’ said the chief, ‘I now understand why
      Carlini stayed behind.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “All savage natures appreciate a desperate deed. No other of the
      bandits would, perhaps, have done the same; but they all understood what
      Carlini had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Now, then,’ cried Carlini, rising in his turn, and
      approaching the corpse, his hand on the butt of one of his pistols,
      ‘does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘No,’ returned the chief, ‘she is thine.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Carlini raised her in his arms, and carried her out of the circle
      of firelight. Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night, and the
      bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks, and lay down before the fire.
      At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm, and in an instant all were on the
      alert. It was Rita’s father, who brought his daughter’s ransom
      in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Here,’ said he, to Cucumetto, ‘here are three
      hundred piastres; give me back my child.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the chief, without taking the money, made a sign to him to
      follow. The old man obeyed. They both advanced beneath the trees, through
      whose branches streamed the moonlight. Cucumetto stopped at last, and
      pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘There,’ said he, ‘demand thy child of Carlini;
      he will tell thee what has become of her;’ and he returned to his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The old man remained motionless; he felt that some great and
      unforeseen misfortune hung over his head. At length he advanced toward the
      group, the meaning of which he could not comprehend. As he approached,
      Carlini raised his head, and the forms of two persons became visible to
      the old man’s eyes. A woman lay on the ground, her head resting on
      the knees of a man, who was seated by her; as he raised his head, the
      woman’s face became visible. The old man recognized his child, and
      Carlini recognized the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I expected thee,’ said the bandit to Rita’s
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Wretch!’ returned the old man, ‘what hast thou
      done?’ and he gazed with terror on Rita, pale and bloody, a knife
      buried in her bosom. A ray of moonlight poured through the trees, and
      lighted up the face of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Cucumetto had violated thy daughter,’ said the bandit;
      ‘I loved her, therefore I slew her; for she would have served as the
      sport of the whole band.’ The old man spoke not, and grew pale as
      death. ‘Now,’ continued Carlini, ‘if I have done
      wrongly, avenge her;’ and withdrawing the knife from the wound in
      Rita’s bosom, he held it out to the old man with one hand, while
      with the other he tore open his vest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Thou hast done well!’ returned the old man in a hoarse
      voice; ‘embrace me, my son.’

    </h5>
    <p>
      Carlini threw himself, sobbing like a child, into the arms of his mistress’s
      father. These were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Now,’ said the old man, ‘aid me to bury my
      child.’ Carlini fetched two pickaxes; and the father and the lover
      began to dig at the foot of a huge oak, beneath which the young girl was
      to repose. When the grave was formed, the father kissed her first, and
      then the lover; afterwards, one taking the head, the other the feet, they
      placed her in the grave. Then they knelt on each side of the grave, and
      said the prayers of the dead. Then, when they had finished, they cast the
      earth over the corpse, until the grave was filled. Then, extending his
      hand, the old man said; ‘I thank you, my son; and now leave me
      alone.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yet——’ replied Carlini.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Leave me, I command you.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Carlini obeyed, rejoined his comrades, folded himself in his cloak,
      and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest. It had been resolved
      the night before to change their encampment. An hour before daybreak,
      Cucumetto aroused his men, and gave the word to march. But Carlini would
      not quit the forest, without knowing what had become of Rita’s
      father. He went toward the place where he had left him. He found the old
      man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his
      daughter’s grave. He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the
      dead body of the one and the tomb of the other. But he was unable to
      complete this oath, for two days afterwards, in an encounter with the
      Roman carbineers, Carlini was killed. There was some surprise, however,
      that, as he was with his face to the enemy, he should have received a ball
      between his shoulders. That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands
      remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlini’s
      rear when he fell. On the morning of the departure from the forest of
      Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness, and heard this oath of
      vengeance, and, like a wise man, anticipated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They told ten other stories of this bandit chief, each more
      singular than the other. Thus, from Fondi to Perusia, everyone trembles at
      the name of Cucumetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between
      Luigi and Teresa. The young girl trembled very much at hearing the
      stories; but Vampa reassured her with a smile, tapping the butt of his
      good fowling-piece, which threw its ball so well; and if that did not
      restore her courage, he pointed to a crow, perched on some dead branch,
      took aim, touched the trigger, and the bird fell dead at the foot of the
      tree. Time passed on, and the two young people had agreed to be married
      when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age. They were
      both orphans, and had only their employers’ leave to ask, which had
      been already sought and obtained. One day when they were talking over
      their plans for the future, they heard two or three reports of firearms,
      and then suddenly a man came out of the wood, near which the two young
      persons used to graze their flocks, and hurried towards them. When he came
      within hearing, he exclaimed: ‘I am pursued; can you conceal me?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “They knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit; but there
      is an innate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and
      the latter is always ready to aid the former. Vampa, without saying a
      word, hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto,
      drew it away, made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there, in a
      retreat unknown to everyone, closed the stone upon him, and then went and
      resumed his seat by Teresa. Instantly afterwards four carbineers, on
      horseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of them appeared to be
      looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by
      the neck. The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side, saw
      the young peasants, and galloping up, began to question them. They had
      seen no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘That is very annoying,’ said the brigadier; for the
      man we are looking for is the chief.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Cucumetto?’ cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes,’ replied the brigadier; ‘and as his head is
      valued at a thousand Roman crowns, there would have been five hundred for
      you, if you had helped us to catch him.’ The two young persons
      exchanged looks. The brigadier had a moment’s hope. Five hundred
      Roman crowns are three thousand lire, and three thousand lire are a
      fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes, it is very annoying,’ said Vampa; ‘but we
      have not seen him.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions,
      but in vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the
      stone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he had
      seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and guessed the
      subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of Luigi and
      Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and he drew from
      his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them. But Vampa
      raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when she thought
      of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of
      gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a
      brigand instead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that
      she was a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing
      several times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Several days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto.
      The time of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a
      grand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were
      invited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked
      permission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be present
      amongst the servants of the house. This was granted. The ball was given by
      the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter Carmela, whom he
      adored. Carmela was precisely the age and figure of Teresa, and Teresa was
      as handsome as Carmela. On the evening of the ball Teresa was attired in
      her best, her most brilliant ornaments in her hair, and gayest glass
      beads,—she was in the costume of the women of Frascati. Luigi wore
      the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday time. They both
      mingled, as they had leave to do, with the servants and peasants.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>festa</i> was magnificent; not only was the villa
      brilliantly illuminated, but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended
      from the trees in the garden; and very soon the palace overflowed to the
      terraces, and the terraces to the garden-walks. At each cross-path was an
      orchestra, and tables spread with refreshments; the guests stopped, formed
      quadrilles, and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased. Carmela
      was attired like a woman of Sonnino. Her cap was embroidered with pearls,
      the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds, her girdle was of Turkey
      silk, with large embroidered flowers, her bodice and skirt were of
      cashmere, her apron of Indian muslin, and the buttons of her corset were
      of jewels. Two of her companions were dressed, the one as a woman of
      Nettuno, and the other as a woman of La Riccia. Four young men of the
      richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian
      freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world. They
      were attired as peasants of Albano, Velletri, Civita-Castellana, and Sora.
      We need hardly add that these peasant costumes, like those of the young
      women, were brilliant with gold and jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Carmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.
      Carmela looked all around her, but not one of the guests had a costume
      similar to her own, or those of her companions. The Count of San-Felice
      pointed out Teresa, who was hanging on Luigi’s arm in a group of
      peasants. ‘Will you allow me, father?’ said Carmela.—‘Certainly,’
      replied the count, ‘are we not in Carnival time?’—Carmela
      turned towards the young man who was talking with her, and saying a few
      words to him, pointed with her finger to Teresa. The young man looked,
      bowed in obedience, and then went to Teresa, and invited her to dance in a
      quadrille directed by the count’s daughter. Teresa felt a flush pass
      over her face; she looked at Luigi, who could not refuse his assent. Luigi
      slowly relinquished Teresa’s arm, which he had held beneath his own,
      and Teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier, took her appointed place
      with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille. Certainly, in the eyes
      of an artist, the exact and strict costume of Teresa had a very different
      character from that of Carmela and her companions; and Teresa was
      frivolous and coquettish, and thus the embroidery and muslins, the
      cashmere waist-girdles, all dazzled her, and the reflection of sapphires
      and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. It was
      like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through
      his whole body. He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her
      cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should swoon;
      every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell were
      ringing in his ears. When they spoke, although Teresa listened timidly and
      with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as Luigi could
      read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his language
      was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with
      him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of
      murder and assassination. Then fearing that his paroxysm might get the
      better of him, he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against
      which he was leaning, and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger
      with a carved handle which was in his belt, and which, unwittingly, he
      drew from the scabbard from time to time. Luigi was jealous! He felt that,
      influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition, Teresa might
      escape him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The young peasant girl, at first timid and scared, soon recovered
      herself. We have said that Teresa was handsome, but this is not all;
      Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more
      potent than our affected and studied elegancies. She had almost all the
      honors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the Count of
      San-Felice’s daughter, we will not undertake to say that Carmela was
      not jealous of her. And with overpowering compliments her handsome
      cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where
      Luigi awaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had
      glanced at Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his
      features were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn from
      its sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it was
      almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover’s arm. The quadrille
      had been most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for a
      repetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of San-Felice
      besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded. One of the cavaliers
      then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it was impossible for the
      quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had disappeared. The truth was,
      that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial, and,
      half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed Teresa toward another
      part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite of herself, but when she
      looked at the agitated countenance of the young man, she understood by his
      silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him.
      She herself was not exempt from internal emotion, and without having done
      anything wrong, yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching
      her. Why, she did not know, but yet she did not the less feel that these
      reproaches were merited.
    </p>
    <p>
      “However, to Teresa’s great astonishment, Luigi remained mute,
      and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of
      the night had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of
      the villa were closed on them for the <i>festa</i> in-doors, he took
      Teresa quite away, and as he left her at her home, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the
      young Countess of San-Felice?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I thought,’ replied the young girl, with all the
      frankness of her nature, ‘that I would give half my life for a
      costume such as she wore.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And what said your cavalier to you?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘He said it only depended on myself to have it, and I had
      only one word to say.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘He was right,’ said Luigi. ‘Do you desire it as
      ardently as you say?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Well, then, you shall have it!’
    </p>
    <p>
      “The young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him,
      but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips.
      As Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes into
      the darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite disappeared, she
      went into the house with a sigh.

      “That night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the
      imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights. The
      Villa of San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of
      the lovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of the flames, she
      sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown, and attempted to
      escape by the door, but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already
      a prey to the flames. She then returned to her room, calling for help as
      loudly as she could, when suddenly her window, which was twenty feet from
      the ground, was opened, a young peasant jumped into the chamber, seized
      her in his arms, and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to
      the turf of the grass-plot, where she fainted. When she recovered, her
      father was by her side. All the servants surrounded her, offering her
      assistance. An entire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that,
      as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured? Her preserver was everywhere
      sought for, but he did not appear; he was inquired after, but no one had
      seen him. Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him. As
      the count was immensely rich, excepting the danger Carmela had run,—and
      the marvellous manner in which she had escaped, made that appear to him
      rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune,—the loss
      occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the
      borders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in high
      spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the
      previous evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so
      cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to her
      when she was not excited or in a passion. Luigi took her arm beneath his
      own, and led her to the door of the grotto. Then he paused. The young
      girl, perceiving that there was something extraordinary, looked at him
      steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Teresa,’ said Luigi, ‘yesterday evening you told
      me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the
      count’s daughter.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes,’ replied Teresa with astonishment; ‘but I
      was mad to utter such a wish.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And I replied, “Very well, you shall have it.”’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes,’ replied the young girl, whose astonishment
      increased at every word uttered by Luigi, ‘but of course your reply
      was only to please me.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,’
      said Luigi proudly. ‘Go into the grotto and dress yourself.’
      At these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto,
      lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid
      mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl
      necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the
      rest of the costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Teresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this
      attire came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed
      into a dressing-room. Luigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest
      of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw
      a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road,
      and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is
      peculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he put
      his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him. Luigi was not mistaken.
      The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, had mistaken his
      way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of a quarter of a
      mile the road again divided into three ways, and on reaching these the
      traveller might again stray from his route, he begged Luigi to be his
      guide. Luigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his
      shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller with
      the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep up with.
      In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross-roads. On
      arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an emperor, he
      stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was
      to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again
      mistake.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And here is your recompense,’ said the traveller,
      offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Thank you,’ said Luigi, drawing back his hand; ‘I
      render a service, I do not sell it.’—‘Well,’
      replied the traveller, who seemed used to this difference between the
      servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer, ‘if
      you refuse wages, you will, perhaps, accept a gift.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Ah, yes, that is another thing.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Then,’ said the traveller, ‘take these two
      Venetian sequins and give them to your bride, to make herself a pair of
      earrings.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And then do you take this poniard,’ said the young
      herdsman; ‘you will not find one better carved between Albano and
      Civita-Castellana.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I accept it,’ answered the traveller, ‘but then
      the obligation will be on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two
      sequins.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘For a dealer perhaps; but for me, who engraved it myself, it
      is hardly worth a piastre.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘What is your name?’ inquired the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Luigi Vampa,’ replied the shepherd, with the same air
      as he would have replied, Alexander, King of Macedon. ‘And yours?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I,’ said the traveller, ‘am called Sinbad the
      Sailor.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz d’Epinay started with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sinbad the Sailor?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the narrator; “that was the name which
      the traveller gave to Vampa as his own.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, and what may you have to say against this name?”
      inquired Albert; “it is a very pretty name, and the adventures of
      the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth, I must
      confess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz said no more. The name of Sinbad the Sailor, as may well be
      supposed, awakened in him a world of recollections, as had the name of the
      Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Proceed!” said he to the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly
      returned by the way he had gone. As he came within two or three hundred
      paces of the grotto, he thought he heard a cry. He listened to know whence
      this sound could proceed. A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own
      name pronounced distinctly. The cry proceeded from the grotto. He bounded
      like a chamois, cocking his carbine as he went, and in a moment reached
      the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the
      traveller. Three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear. He cast
      his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa, as Nessus, the
      centaur, carried Deianira.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This man, who was hastening towards the wood, was already
      three-quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest. Vampa
      measured the distance; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance
      of him, and there was not a chance of overtaking him. The young shepherd
      stopped, as if his feet had been rooted to the ground; then he put the
      butt of his carbine to his shoulder, took aim at the ravisher, followed
      him for a second in his track, and then fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The ravisher stopped suddenly, his knees bent under him, and he
      fell with Teresa in his arms. The young girl rose instantly, but the man
      lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death. Vampa then rushed
      towards Teresa; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed
      her, and she had dropped on her knees, so that the young man feared that
      the ball that had brought down his enemy, had also wounded his betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fortunately, she was unscathed, and it was fright alone that had
      overcome Teresa. When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and
      unharmed, he turned towards the wounded man. He had just expired, with
      clenched hands, his mouth in a spasm of agony, and his hair on end in the
      sweat of death. His eyes remained open and menacing. Vampa approached the
      corpse, and recognized Cucumetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      “From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young
      peasants, he had been enamoured of Teresa, and had sworn she should be
      his. From that time he had watched them, and profiting by the moment when
      her lover had left her alone, had carried her off, and believed he at
      length had her in his power, when the ball, directed by the unerring skill
      of the young herdsman, had pierced his heart. Vampa gazed on him for a
      moment without betraying the slightest emotion; while, on the contrary,
      Teresa, shuddering in every limb, dared not approach the slain ruffian but
      by degrees, and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the
      shoulder of her lover. Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress:—‘Ah,’
      said he—‘good, good! You are dressed; it is now my turn to
      dress myself.’
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of
      San-Felice’s daughter. Vampa took Cucumetto’s body in his arms
      and conveyed it to the grotto, while in her turn Teresa remained outside.
      If a second traveller had passed, he would have seen a strange thing,—a
      shepherdess watching her flock, clad in a cashmere grown, with ear-rings
      and necklace of pearls, diamond pins, and buttons of sapphires, emeralds,
      and rubies. He would, no doubt, have believed that he had returned to the
      times of Florian, and would have declared, on reaching Paris, that he had
      met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine Hill. At the
      end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto; his costume was no
      less elegant than that of Teresa. He wore a vest of garnet-colored velvet,
      with buttons of cut gold; a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery; a
      Roman scarf tied round his neck; a cartridge-box worked with gold, and red
      and green silk; sky-blue velvet breeches, fastened above the knee with
      diamond buckles; garters of deerskin, worked with a thousand arabesques,
      and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors; two watches hung from his
      girdle, and a splendid poniard was in his belt. Teresa uttered a cry of
      admiration. Vampa in this attire resembled a painting by Leopold Robert or
      Schnetz. He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumetto. The young man saw
      the effect produced on his betrothed, and a smile of pride passed over his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Now,’ he said to Teresa, ‘are you ready to share
      my fortune, whatever it may be?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Oh, yes!’ exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And follow me wherever I go?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘To the world’s end.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he
      was conducting her, for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome,
      proud, and powerful as a god. They went towards the forest, and soon
      entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known
      to Vampa; he therefore went forward without a moment’s hesitation,
      although there was no beaten track, but he knew his path by looking at the
      trees and bushes, and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a
      half. At the end of this time they had reached the thickest of the forest.
      A torrent, whose bed was dry, led into a deep gorge. Vampa took this wild
      road, which, enclosed between two ridges, and shadowed by the tufted
      umbrage of the pines, seemed, but for the difficulties of its descent,
      that path to Avernus of which Virgil speaks. Teresa had become alarmed at
      the wild and deserted look of the plain around her, and pressed closely
      against her guide, not uttering a syllable; but as she saw him advance
      with even step and composed countenance, she endeavored to repress her
      emotion. Suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a
      tree and aimed at Vampa.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Not another step,’ he said, ‘or you are a dead
      man.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘What, then,’ said Vampa, raising his hand with a
      gesture of disdain, while Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm,
      clung closely to him, ‘do wolves rend each other?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Who are you?’ inquired the sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘What do you want?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at
      Rocca Bianca.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Follow me, then,’ said the sentinel; ‘or, as you
      know your way, go first.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the
      bandit, went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm
      and easy step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a
      sign to stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice
      imitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Good!’ said the sentry, ‘you may now go on.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Luigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung
      tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of
      carbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top of
      a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a volcano—an
      extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had deserted Alba
      to come and found the city of Rome. Teresa and Luigi reached the summit,
      and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,’
      said the sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘What has he to say?’ inquired the young man who was in
      command in the chief’s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd’s life,’
      was Vampa’s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Ah, I understand,’ said the lieutenant; ‘and you
      seek admittance into our ranks?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Welcome!’ cried several bandits from Ferrusino,
      Pampinara, and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your
      companion.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And what may that be?’ inquired the bandits with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I come to ask to be your captain,’ said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The bandits shouted with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And what have you done to aspire to this honor?’
      demanded the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear;
      and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my
      betrothed.’ An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice
      Cucumetto deceased.”

    <p>
      “Well, my dear Albert,” said Franz, turning towards his
      friend; “what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say he is a myth,” replied Albert, “and never had an
      existence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what may a myth be?” inquired Pastrini.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,” replied
      Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this
      moment in the environs of Rome?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an
      example.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the
      plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast. They
      seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they follow him on
      the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue him, and he has
      suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio, Guanouti, or Monte
      Cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he reappears suddenly at Albano,
      Tivoli, or La Riccia.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how does he behave towards travellers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas! his plan is very simple. It depends on the distance he may be
      from the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day
      wherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows
      another hour’s grace. At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the
      money is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner’s brains with a
      pistol-shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the
      account.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Albert,” inquired Franz of his companion, “are
      you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quite so,” said Albert, “if the way be picturesque.”
      The clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared. “Excellencies,”
      said he, “the coach is ready.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” said Franz, “let us to the Colosseum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the streets, <i>morbleu!</i> by the streets!” cried Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my dear fellow,” said Albert, rising, and lighting his
      third cigar, “really, I thought you had more courage.” So
      saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the
      carriage.

    <h2>
      Chapter 34. The Colosseum
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ranz had so
      managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a
      single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression interfered to
      mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to
      admire. The road selected was a continuation of the Via Sistina; then by
      cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands Santa Maria
      Maggiore and proceeding by the Via Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli, the
      travellers would find themselves directly opposite the Colosseum.
    </p>
    <p>
      This itinerary possessed another great advantage,—that of leaving
      Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of
      Signor Pastrini’s story, in which his mysterious host of Monte
      Cristo was so strangely mixed up. Seated with folded arms in a corner of
      the carriage, he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so
      lately listened to, and to ask himself an interminable number of questions
      touching its various circumstances without, however, arriving at a
      satisfactory reply to any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fact more than the rest brought his friend “Sinbad the Sailor”
      back to his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy
      that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and Pastrini’s
      account of Vampa’s having found refuge on board the vessels of
      smugglers and fishermen, reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had
      found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which had
      even deviated from its course and touched at Porto-Vecchio for the sole
      purpose of landing them. The very name assumed by his host of Monte Cristo
      and again repeated by the landlord of the Hôtel de Londres, abundantly
      proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on
      the shores of Piombino, Civita Vecchia, Ostia, and Gaëta, as on those of
      Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and further, Franz bethought him of having
      heard his singular entertainer speak both of Tunis and Palermo, proving
      thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these
      reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning
      ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various openings of which
      the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the
      eyes of the wandering dead. The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans; the
      door was opened, and the young men, eagerly alighting, found themselves
      opposite a <i>cicerone</i>, who appeared to have sprung up from the
      ground, so unexpected was his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two
      conductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply of
      guides; besides the ordinary <i>cicerone</i>, who seizes upon you directly
      you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the
      city, there is also a special <i>cicerone</i> belonging to each monument—nay,
      almost to each part of a monument. It may, therefore, be easily imagined
      there is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum, that wonder of all ages,
      which Martial thus eulogizes:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids,
      and the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to
      the superiority of the gigantic labor of the Cæsars, and the many voices
      of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable
      monument.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their <i>ciceronian</i>
      tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more difficult to
      break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to visit these
      monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the young men made no
      attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves
      into the care and custody of their conductors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the Colosseum,
      while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the
      classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian; and, to his
      credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity of the guides,
      was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he
      saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be
      formed save by such as have visited them, and more especially by
      moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice
      as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky,
      whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a
      glow equal to the soft twilight of an eastern clime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps
      beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, than, abandoning Albert to the
      guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying
      their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as regularly
      followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various
      objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal, beginning, as a
      matter of course, with the “Lions’ Den”, the “Hall
      of the Gladiators” and finishing with “Cæsar’s Podium”),
      to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was
      surrounded, Franz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them
      to follow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column,
      and immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy a
      full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the
      shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place, and
      from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his guides, who,
      holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a vomitorium at the
      opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again disappeared down the
      steps conducting to the seats reserved for the Vestal virgins, resembling,
      as they glided along, some restless shades following the flickering glare
      of so many <i>ignes-fatui</i>. All at once his ear caught a sound
      resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by
      which he had himself ascended. There was nothing remarkable in the
      circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily
      below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath
      the pressure of a foot, and also that someone, who endeavored as much as
      possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard, was approaching the
      spot where he sat. Conjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a
      man was distinctly visible to Franz, gradually emerging from the staircase
      opposite, upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of
      silvery brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like
      Franz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the
      frivolous gabble of the guides. And his appearance had nothing
      extraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded, stopping
      and listening with anxious attention at every step he took, convinced
      Franz that he expected the arrival of some person. By a sort of
      instinctive impulse, Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof had
      given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be seen the
      blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free
      entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile, grew
      a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood out in
      bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large masses
      of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm, and
      hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz
      stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to distinguish
      his features, although his dress was easily made out. He wore a large
      brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, served
      likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance, while the upper part
      was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat. The lower part of his
      dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon, which,
      entering through the broken ceiling, shed their refulgent beams on feet
      cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather, over which descended
      fashionably cut trousers of black cloth.

    </h5>
    <p>
      From the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to one
      conclusion,—that the person whom he was thus watching certainly
      belonged to no inferior station of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest
      signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in
      the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the
      flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was clearly
      seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him; then, as
      his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a floating mass of
      thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help to within three or
      four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on his feet. The man who
      had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the
      Transtevere costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg your excellency’s pardon for keeping you waiting,”
      said the man, in the Roman dialect, “but I don’t think I’m
      many minutes after my time, ten o’clock has just struck by the clock
      of Saint John Lateran.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say not a word about being late,” replied the stranger in
      purest Tuscan; “‘tis I who am too soon. But even if you had
      caused me to wait a little while, I should have felt quite sure that the
      delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,” said the
      man; “I came here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an
      immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who is Beppo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year
      to let me know what is going on within his holiness’s castle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed! You are a provident person, I see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you see, no one knows what may happen. Perhaps some of these
      days I may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have
      some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me
      out of prison.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Briefly, what did you learn?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That two executions of considerable interest will take place the
      day after tomorrow at two o’clock, as is customary at Rome at the
      commencement of all great festivals. One of the culprits will be <i>mazzolato</i>;
      [*] he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who brought him
      up, and deserves not the smallest pity. The other sufferer is sentenced to
      be <i>decapitato</i>; [**] and he, your excellency, is poor Peppino.”
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * Knocked on the head.

     ** Beheaded.
</pre>
    <p>
      “The fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical
      government, but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear, that
      they are glad of all opportunity of making an example.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Peppino did not even belong to my band: he was merely a poor
      shepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes. But
      mark the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on
      the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply
      sentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the
      day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every spectator.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to
      surprise them with.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good friend,” said the man in the cloak, “excuse me
      for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild
      or extravagant act.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to
      stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this
      scrape solely from having served me. I should hate and despise myself as a
      coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what do you mean to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a
      signal from me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for
      execution, and, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the
      guard, and carry off the prisoner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that
      my scheme is far better than yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is your excellency’s project?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just this. I will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the
      person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino;
      and during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres will afford
      him the means of escaping from his prison.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you feel sure of succeeding?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu!</i>” exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly
      expressing himself in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did your excellency say?” inquired the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I said, my good fellow, that I would do more single-handed by the
      means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos,
      pistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included. Leave me, then, to act, and
      have no fears for the result.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in
      readiness, in case your excellency should fail.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None whatever. Take what precautions you please, if it is any
      satisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I
      seek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and
      that you have but one day to work in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what of that? Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each
      hour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty seconds?
      Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that is very easily arranged. I have engaged the three lower
      windows at the Café Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite pardon
      for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks, and
      the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer
      directing the execution?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Send one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and I will
      give it to him. His dress will procure him the means of approaching the
      scaffold itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer,
      who, in his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it
      will be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if it
      be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because in
      either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency,” said the man, “you are fully
      persuaded of my entire devotion to you, are you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,”
      replied the cavalier in the cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and
      henceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute
      obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render
      to another.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may
      remind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period, when
      I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me
      what I have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end
      of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may
      regard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush!” interrupted the stranger; “I hear a noise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis some travellers, who are visiting the Colosseum by
      torchlight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides
      are nothing but spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I
      may be honored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of
      our intimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit
      would suffer thereby.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white
      damask, bearing a red cross.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if you fail?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then all three windows will have yellow draperies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please,
      and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We understand each other perfectly, then. Adieu, your excellency;
      depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase, while
      his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in the folds
      of his mantle, passed almost close to Franz, and descended to the arena by
      an outward flight of steps. The next minute Franz heard himself called by
      Albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the sound of his friend’s
      name. Franz, however, did not obey the summons till he had satisfied
      himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a
      sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent. In
      ten minutes after the strangers had departed, Franz was on the road to the
      Piazza di Spagna, listening with studied indifference to the learned
      dissertation delivered by Albert, after the manner of Pliny and
      Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious
      beasts from springing on the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear
      what was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that had
      occurred. One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum he
      had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger to him, but not
      so the other; and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his
      features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the
      shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him
      the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them, hear
      them when or where he might. It was more especially when this man was
      speaking in a manner half jesting, half bitter, that Franz’s ear
      recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet well-pitched voice that had
      addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and which he heard for the
      second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum. And
      the more he thought, the more entire was his conviction, that the person
      who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer,
      “Sinbad the Sailor.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Under any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to
      resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage, and
      with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but in the
      present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he had
      overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at such a
      time would be anything but agreeable. As we have seen, therefore, he
      permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition, but
      fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance
      should chance afford him another opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which
      assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep. Slumber
      refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish
      contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity
      of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the inhabitant of the
      grotto of Monte Cristo; and the more he thought, the firmer grew his
      opinion on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn out at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till
      late. Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in arranging
      for the evening’s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at the
      Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write,
      relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o’clock Albert returned, delighted with his day’s
      work; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had
      received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be
      possible for him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it)
      all the remarkable sights at Rome. Yes, in a single day he had
      accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks
      to effect. Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to
      be played that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers
      appeared in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera of <i>Parisina</i> was announced for representation, and the
      principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La Specchia. The young men,
      therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the
      opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of <i>Lucia
      di Lammermoor</i>, supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of
      Italy. Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with
      their orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of
      balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had
      had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the Opera.
      Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and effective
      costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his elegant toilet
      was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy representatives of
      Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he
      had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a single adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but
      internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to
      think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of
      any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have
      his labor for his pains. And the thing was so much the more annoying, as,
      according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had quitted
      Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy
      to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should astonish the
      Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his way;
      the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all faithful, if not
      to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of changing
      even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf; and all he gained
      was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage
      over those of France, that they are faithful even in their infidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there might
      be an exception to the general rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also
      possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a viscount—a
      recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it is not
      necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a
      genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or merely
      1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf commanded an
      income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to render him a
      personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was therefore no small
      mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy
      without having excited the most trifling observation. Albert, however,
      hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during
      the Carnival, knowing full well that among the different states and
      kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated, Rome is the spot where
      even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives,
      and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Carnival was to commence on the morrow; therefore Albert had not an
      instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes, expectations,
      and claims to notice. With this design he had engaged a box in the most
      conspicuous part of the theatre, and exerted himself to set off his
      personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet. The
      box taken by Albert was in the first circle; although each of the three
      tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason,
      generally styled the “nobility’s boxes,” and although
      the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain
      at least a dozen persons, it had cost less than would be paid at some of
      the French theatres for one admitting merely four occupants. Another
      motive had influenced Albert’s selection of his seat,—who knew
      but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the
      notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would
      procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely
      balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival?
    </p>
    <p>
      These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to please
      than he had hitherto been. Totally disregarding the business of the stage,
      he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of
      each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas, this
      attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had been
      excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures, into whose
      good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much engrossed with
      themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that they had not so much
      as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass.
    </p>

      The truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the
      “holy week” that was to succeed it, so filled every fair
      breast, as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the
      business of the stage. The actors made their entries and exits unobserved
      or unthought of; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would
      suddenly cease their conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings,
      to listen to some brilliant effort of Moriani’s, a well-executed
      recitative by Coselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers
      of La Specchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly relapsed
      into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been
      hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been
      introduced in Paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was. The
      quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend
      beheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily, “Do
      you know the woman who has just entered that box?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; what do you think of her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, she is perfectly lovely—what a complexion! And such
      magnificent hair! Is she French?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; a Venetian.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And her name is——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Countess G——.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I know her by name!” exclaimed Albert; “she is said
      to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty. I was to have been
      presented to her when I met her at Madame Villefort’s ball.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?” asked
      Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to
      venture to take me to her box?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, I have only had the honor of being in her society and
      conversing with her three or four times in my life; but you know that even
      such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.”
      At that instant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her
      hand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head.
      “Upon my word,” said Albert, “you seem to be on
      excellent terms with the beautiful countess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are mistaken in thinking so,” returned Franz calmly;
      “but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our
      countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders,—I mean that of
      judging the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions;
      believe me, nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the
      degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar
      terms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant
      between ourselves and the countess—nothing more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there, indeed, my good fellow? Pray tell me, is it sympathy of
      heart?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; of taste,” continued Franz gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the countess’s visiting the Colosseum, as we did last
      night, by moonlight, and nearly alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were with her, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did you say to her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin
      is a glorious monument!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word,” cried Albert, “you must have been a very
      entertaining companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in
      such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better
      to talk about than the dead! All I can say is, if ever I should get such a
      chance, the living should be my theme.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “And you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Albert, breaking in upon his discourse, “never
      mind the past; let us only remember the present. Are you not going to keep
      your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a confounded long time this first act lasts. I believe, on my
      soul, that they never mean to finish it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale. How
      exquisitely Coselli sings his part.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, what do you say to La Specchia? Did you ever see
      anything more perfect than her acting?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to
      Malibran and Sontag, such singers as these don’t make the same
      impression on you they perhaps do on others.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least, you must admire Moriani’s style and execution.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with
      a voice like a woman’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good friend,” said Franz, turning to him, while Albert
      continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre, “you seem
      determined not to approve; you are really too difficult to please.”
      The curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite
      satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly
      passed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and wristbands,
      and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way. Franz,
      who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her a gracious
      smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to retard the
      gratification of Albert’s eager impatience, but began at once the
      tour of the house, closely followed by Albert, who availed himself of the
      few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle
      the height and smoothness of his collar, and to arrange the lappets of his
      coat. This important task was just completed as they arrived at the
      countess’s box. At the knock, the door was immediately opened, and
      the young man who was seated beside the countess, in obedience to the
      Italian custom, instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers,
      who, in turn, would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the
      day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents;
      nor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the circle in which
      the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection.
      Franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at having been prevented
      the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris,
      was most anxious to make up for it, and had requested him (Franz) to
      remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box, and concluded by
      asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do
      so. The countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to Albert, and extended her
      hand with cordial kindness to Franz; then, inviting Albert to take the
      vacant seat beside her, she recommended Franz to take the next best, if he
      wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own chair.
      Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian
      matters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew
      there. Franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and,
      unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up
      Albert’s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting alone, in the front of a box immediately opposite, but situated on
      the third row, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a Greek
      costume, which evidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore it,
      was her national attire. Behind her, but in deep shadow, was the outline
      of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter personage it was
      not possible to distinguish. Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the
      apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and
      Albert, to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian
      opposite, since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by
      either sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All I can tell about her,” replied the countess, “is,
      that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her
      where she now sits the very first night of the season, and since then she
      has never missed a performance. Sometimes she is accompanied by the person
      who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black
      servant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what do you think of her personal appearance?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I consider her perfectly lovely—she is just my idea of
      what Medora must have been.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed her
      conversation with Albert, while Franz returned to his previous survey of
      the house and company. The curtain rose on the ballet, which was one of
      those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably arranged and
      put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself a great
      reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic
      art—one of those masterly productions of grace, method, and elegance
      in which the whole <i>corps de ballet</i>, from the principal dancers to
      the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at the same time;
      and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude,
      or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement, that would
      lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of volition, influenced the
      moving mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ballet was called <i>Poliska</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too
      deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while she
      seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it, her
      eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of
      her companion, who, during the whole time the piece lasted, never even
      moved, not even when the furious, crashing din produced by the trumpets,
      cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra. Of
      this he took no heed, but was, as far as appearances might be trusted,
      enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ballet at length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the loud,
      unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera
      with a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the
      singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their
      costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their pirouettes
      and exhibiting their graceful steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the
      leader’s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly
      arise and approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to
      him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she became
      as absorbed as before in what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely
      in the shade, that, though Franz tried his utmost, he could not
      distinguish a single feature. The curtain rose, and the attention of Franz
      was attracted by the actors; and his eyes turned from the box containing
      the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my readers are aware that the second act of <i>Parisina</i> opens
      with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina, while sleeping,
      betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo. The injured husband goes
      through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction seizes on his mind,
      and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation, he awakens his guilty wife
      to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his
      vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This duet is one of the most beautiful, expressive and terrible
      conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti.
      Franz now listened to it for the third time; yet its notes, so tenderly
      expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent
      to their different griefs and passions, thrilled through the soul of Franz
      with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it. Excited beyond
      his usual calm demeanor, Franz rose with the audience, and was about to
      join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed; but suddenly his
      purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and the half-uttered
      “bravos” expired on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the
      universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand up in
      front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had no
      difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte
      Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening
      in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had seemed so
      familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All doubt of his identity was now at an end; his singular host evidently
      resided at Rome. The surprise and agitation occasioned by this full
      confirmation of Franz’s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a
      corresponding expression to his features; for the countess, after gazing
      with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of laughter, and begged
      to know what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Countess,” returned Franz, totally unheeding her raillery,
      “I asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars
      respecting the Albanian lady opposite; I must now beseech you to inform me
      who and what is her husband?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay,” answered the countess, “I know no more of him
      than yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps you never before noticed him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a question—so truly French! Do you not know that we
      Italians have eyes only for the man we love?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” replied Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All I can say is,” continued the countess, taking up the <i>lorgnette</i>,
      and directing it toward the box in question, “that the gentleman,
      whose history I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just
      been dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly
      grave-digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours,
      than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,” said
      Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you know him?” almost screamed the countess. “Oh,
      pray do, for heaven’s sake, tell us all about—is he a vampire,
      or a resuscitated corpse, or what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I can well understand,” said the countess, shrugging up
      her beautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through
      her veins, “that those who have once seen that man will never be
      likely to forget him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself;
      another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same unaccountable awe
      and misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well.” inquired Franz, after the countess had a second time
      directed her <i>lorgnette</i> at the box, “what do you think of our
      opposite neighbor?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living
      form.” This fresh allusion to Byron [*] drew a smile to Franz’s
      countenance; although he could but allow that if anything was likely to
      induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of
      such a man as the mysterious personage before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must positively find out who and what he is,” said Franz,
      rising from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” cried the countess; “you must not leave me. I
      depend upon you to escort me home. Oh, indeed, I cannot permit you to go.”
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * Scott, of course: “The son of an ill-fated sire, and the
     father of a yet more unfortunate family, bore in his looks
     that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the
     physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those
     who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death.”—The
     Abbot, ch. xxii.
</pre>
    <p>
      “Is it possible,” whispered Franz, “that you entertain
      any fear?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll tell you,” answered the countess. “Byron had
      the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me
      that he had seen them. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds
      with the features and character of the man before us. Oh, he is the exact
      personification of what I have been led to expect! The coal-black hair,
      large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems
      burning,—the same ghastly paleness. Then observe, too, that the
      woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex. She is a
      foreigner—a stranger. Nobody knows who she is, or where she comes
      from. No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does, and is, like
      himself, a dealer in magical arts. I entreat of you not to go near him—at
      least tonight; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great,
      pursue your researches if you will; but tonight you neither can nor shall.
      For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself.” Franz protested
      he could not defer his pursuit till the following day, for many reasons.
      “Listen to me,” said the countess, “and do not be so
      very headstrong. I am going home. I have a party at my house tonight, and
      therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the opera. Now, I cannot
      for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady
      your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat, open
      the door of the box, and offer the countess his arm. It was quite evident,
      by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz himself
      could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread—so much the
      stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative
      recollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive
      belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened
      to till she believed them truths. Franz could even feel her arm tremble as
      he assisted her into the carriage. Upon arriving at her hotel, Franz
      perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company;
      on the contrary, her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly
      to astonish the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse my little subterfuge,” said the countess, in reply to
      her companion’s half-reproachful observation on the subject; “but
      that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I longed to be
      alone, that I might compose my startled mind.” Franz essayed to
      smile. “Nay,” said she, “do not smile; it ill accords
      with the expression of your countenance, and I am sure it does not spring
      from your heart. However, promise me one thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Promise me, I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do anything you desire, except relinquish my determination
      of finding out who this man is. I have more reasons than you can imagine
      for desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is
      going.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where he comes from I am ignorant; but I can readily tell you where
      he is going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,” said
      Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, you must give me your word to return immediately to
      your hotel, and make no attempt to follow this man tonight. There are
      certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet
      afterwards. For heaven’s sake, do not serve as a conductor between
      that man and me. Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you
      please; but never bring him near me, if you would not see me die of
      terror. And now, good-night; go to your rooms, and try to sleep away all
      recollections of this evening. For my own part, I am quite sure I shall
      not be able to close my eyes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the countess quitted Franz, leaving him unable to decide
      whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her
      fears and agitations were genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his return to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown and
      slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar. “My dear
      fellow.” cried he, springing up, “is it really you? Why, I did
      not expect to see you before tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Albert,” replied Franz, “I am glad of this
      opportunity to tell you, once and forever, that you entertain a most
      erroneous notion concerning Italian women. I should have thought the
      continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might
      have taught you better by this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my soul, these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them
      aright. Why, here—they give you their hand—they press yours in
      return—they keep up a whispering conversation—permit you to
      accompany them home. Why, if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of
      these marks of flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the very reason why the women of this fine country put so
      little restraint on their words and actions, is because they live so much
      in public, and have really nothing to conceal. Besides, you must have
      perceived that the countess was really alarmed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At what? At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting
      opposite to us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl? Now, for my
      part, I met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang
      me, if I can guess where you took your notions of the other world from. I
      can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking
      fellow—admirably dressed. Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of
      his clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor—probably
      Blin or Humann. He was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know,
      paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent
      and distinguished breeding.” Franz smiled; for he well remembered
      that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in
      his own complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,” said Franz,
      “that the countess’s suspicions were destitute alike of sense
      and reason. Did he speak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his
      words?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect. I knew that
      from the mixture of Greek words. I don’t know whether I ever told
      you that when I was at college I was rather—rather strong in Greek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He spoke the Romaic language, did he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That settles it,” murmured Franz. “‘Tis he, past
      all doubt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing, nothing. But tell me, what were you thinking about when I
      came in?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed. Of what nature?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means
      afforded to endeavor to get one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my
      brain.” Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence
      in the suggestions of his imagination. “I tell you what, Sir Franz,”
      cried Albert, “you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and
      incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your
      scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, hearken to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I listen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You agree, do you not, that obtaining a carriage is out of the
      question?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Neither can we procure horses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True; we have offered any sum, but have failed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, now, what do you say to a cart? I dare say such a thing might
      be had.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very possibly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And a pair of oxen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As easily found as the cart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our
      business can be managed. The cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if
      you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers, we may get up a striking
      tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by Leopold Robert. It
      would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the
      costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento. Our group would then be
      quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough
      to represent a madonna.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Franz, “this time, M. Albert, I am bound to
      give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And quite a national one, too,” replied Albert with gratified
      pride. “A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities. Ha, ha, ye
      Romans! you thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of
      your processions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses
      are to be had in your beggarly city. But you don’t know us; when we
      can’t have one thing we invent another.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only to our host. Upon my return home I sent for him, and I then
      explained to him what I wished to procure. He assured me that nothing
      would be easier than to furnish all I desired. One thing I was sorry for;
      when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded, he told me there would
      not be time, as it would require three days to do that; so you see we must
      do without this little superfluity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where is he now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our host.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too
      late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I expect him every minute.” At this instant the door
      opened, and the head of Signor Pastrini appeared. “<i>Permesso</i>?”
      inquired he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly—certainly,” cried Franz. “Come in, my
      host.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, then,” asked Albert eagerly, “have you found the
      desired cart and oxen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Better than that!” replied Signor Pastrini, with the air of a
      man perfectly well satisfied with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take care, my worthy host,” said Albert, “<i>better</i>
      is a sure enemy to <i>well</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me,” returned
      Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what <i>have</i> you done?” asked Franz. “Speak
      out, there’s a worthy fellow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellencies are aware,” responded the landlord,
      swelling with importance, “that the Count of Monte Cristo is living
      on the same floor with yourselves!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should think we did know it,” exclaimed Albert, “since
      it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small
      rooms, like two poor students in the back streets of Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When, then, the Count of Monte Cristo, hearing of the dilemma in
      which you are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two
      places at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli.” The friends looked at
      each other with unutterable surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But do you think,” asked Albert, “that we ought to
      accept such offers from a perfect stranger?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo?” asked
      Franz of his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A very great nobleman, but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot
      exactly say; but this I know, that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a
      gold mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems to me,” said Franz, speaking in an undertone to
      Albert, “that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our
      landlord, he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel,
      and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way. He
      would have written—or——”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant someone knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in,” said Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness, appeared
      at the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlord’s hands,
      who forthwith presented them to the two young men, he said, “Please
      to deliver these, from the Count of Monte Cristo to Viscomte Albert de
      Morcerf and M. Franz d’Epinay. The Count of Monte Cristo,”
      continued the servant, “begs these gentlemen’s permission to
      wait upon them as their neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation
      of what time they will please to receive him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Faith, Franz,” whispered Albert, “there is not much to
      find fault with here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell the count,” replied Franz, “that we will do
      ourselves the pleasure of calling on him.” The servant bowed and
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what I call an elegant mode of attack,” said Albert,
      “You were quite correct in what you said, Signor Pastrini. The Count
      of Monte Cristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and
      knowledge of the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you accept his offer?” said the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course we do,” replied Albert. “Still, I must own I
      am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers—it
      would have produced such an effect! And were it not for the windows at the
      Palazzo Rospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful
      scheme, I don’t know but what I should have held on by my original
      plan. What say you, Franz?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone
      decided me.” The truth was, that the mention of two places in the
      Palazzo Rospoli had recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard
      the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious
      unknown and the Transteverin, in which the stranger in the cloak had
      undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this
      muffled-up individual proved (as Franz felt sure he would) the same as the
      person he had just seen in the Teatro Argentina, then he should be able to
      establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches respecting
      him with perfect facility and freedom. Franz passed the night in confused
      dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious
      tormentor, and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce.
      The next day must clear up every doubt; and unless his near neighbor and
      would-be friend, the Count of Monte Cristo, possessed the ring of Gyges,
      and by its power was able to render himself invisible, it was very certain
      he could not escape this time. Eight o’clock found Franz up and
      dressed, while Albert, who had not the same motives for early rising, was
      still soundly asleep. The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord,
      who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray, Signor Pastrini,” asked Franz, “is not some
      execution appointed to take place today?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you
      may procure a window to view it from, you are much too late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” answered Franz, “I had no such intention; and
      even if I had felt a wish to witness the spectacle, I might have done so
      from Monte Pincio—could I not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” exclaimed mine host, “I did not think it likely
      your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are
      always collected on that hill, which, indeed, they consider as exclusively
      belonging to themselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very possibly I may not go,” answered Franz; “but in
      case I feel disposed, give me some particulars of today’s
      executions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What particulars would your excellency like to hear?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and
      description of the death they are to die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That happens just lucky, your excellency! Only a few minutes ago
      they brought me the <i>tavolettas</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are they?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the
      evening before an execution, on which is pasted up a paper containing the
      names of the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment. The
      reason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and faithful
      Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits, and,
      above all, beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers
      to those of the faithful, are they?” asked Franz somewhat
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, dear, no, your excellency! I have not time for anybody’s
      affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests; but I make an
      agreement with the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me
      as he would the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel
      should like to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite
      information concerning the time and place etc.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part,
      Signor Pastrini,” cried Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, your excellency,” returned the landlord, chuckling and
      rubbing his hands with infinite complacency, “I think I may take
      upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage
      of the noble visitors to this poor hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely
      upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests
      wherever I go. Meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these <i>tavolettas</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency’s
      wish,” said the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; “I
      have caused one to be placed on the landing, close by your apartment.”
      Then, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23d,
      being the first day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the
      Piazza del Popolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons,
      named Andrea Rondolo, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the
      former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest,
      named Don César Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the
      latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary
      bandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band. The first-named malefactor will be <i>mazzolato</i>,
      the second culprit <i>decapitato</i>. The prayers of all good Christians
      are entreated for these unfortunate men, that it may please God to awaken
      them to a sense of their guilt, and to grant them a hearty and sincere
      repentance for their crimes.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of
      the Colosseum. No part of the programme differed,—the names of the
      condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed with
      his previous information. In all probability, therefore, the Transteverin
      was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the man shrouded in
      the mantle the same he had known as “Sinbad the Sailor,” but
      who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in Rome, as
      he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis. Time was getting on,
      however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert; but at the moment
      he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his friend entered the room in
      perfect costume for the day. The anticipated delights of the Carnival had
      so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, my excellent Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, addressing
      his landlord, “since we are both ready, do you think we may proceed
      at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most assuredly,” replied he. “The Count of Monte Cristo
      is always an early riser; and I can answer for his having been up these
      two hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our
      respects to him directly?”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Oh, I am quite sure. I will take all the blame on myself if you
      find I have led you into an error.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perfectly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, let us do so.” The landlord preceded the friends across
      the landing, which was all that separated them from the apartments of the
      count, rang at the bell, and, upon the door being opened by a servant,
      said, “<i>I signori Francesi</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter. They passed
      through two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected
      to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into an elegantly
      fitted-up drawing-room. The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor, and
      the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and sofas, offered
      their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or
      refreshment. Splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against
      the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies of war, while heavy
      curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of
      the room. “If your excellencies will please to be seated,”
      said the man, “I will let the count know that you are here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried <i>portières</i>.
      As the door opened, the sound of a <i>guzla</i> reached the ears of the
      young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid closing of the
      door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter. Franz and Albert
      looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous furnishings of the
      apartment. Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had
      done at their first rapid survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Franz to his friend, “what think you of all
      this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant
      and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has
      speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling <i>incog</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush, hush!” replied Franz; “we shall ascertain who and
      what he is—he comes!” As Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a
      door turning on its hinges, and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry
      was drawn aside, and the owner of all these riches stood before the two
      young men. Albert instantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a
      manner, spellbound on his chair; for in the person of him who had just
      entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum,
      and the occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his
      extraordinary host of Monte Cristo.

      Chapter 35. La Mazzolata
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>entlemen,”
      said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, “I pray you excuse me
      for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to disturb you by
      presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides, you sent me word
      that you would come to me, and I have held myself at your disposal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,”
      returned Albert; “you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we
      were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly
      invitation reached us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed,” returned the count, motioning the two young men to
      sit down. “It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini, that I did
      not sooner assist you in your distress. He did not mention a syllable of
      your embarrassment to me, when he knows that, alone and isolated as I am,
      I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors. As
      soon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized the
      opportunity of offering my services.” The two young men bowed. Franz
      had, as yet, found nothing to say; he had come to no determination, and as
      nothing in the count’s manner manifested the wish that he should
      recognize him, he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past,
      or wait until he had more proof; besides, although sure it was he who had
      been in the box the previous evening, he could not be equally positive
      that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum. He resolved,
      therefore, to let things take their course without making any direct
      overture to the count. Moreover, he had this advantage, he was master of
      the count’s secret, while the count had no hold on Franz, who had
      nothing to conceal. However, he resolved to lead the conversation to a
      subject which might possibly clear up his doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count,” said he, “you have offered us places in your
      carriage, and at your windows in the Rospoli Palace. Can you tell us where
      we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del Popolo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the count negligently, looking attentively at
      Morcerf, “is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza
      del Popolo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to
      the point he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stay, I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this;
      perhaps I can render you this slight service also.” He extended his
      hand, and rang the bell thrice. “Did you ever occupy yourself,”
      said he to Franz, “with the employment of time and the means of
      simplifying the summoning your servants? I have. When I ring once, it is
      for my valet; twice, for my majordomo; thrice, for my steward,—thus
      I do not waste a minute or a word. Here he is.” A man of about
      forty-five or fifty entered, exactly resembling the smuggler who had
      introduced Franz into the cavern; but he did not appear to recognize him.
      It was evident he had his orders. “Monsieur Bertuccio,” said
      the count, “you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del
      Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, excellency,” returned the steward; “but it was
      very late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did I not tell you I wished for one?” replied the count,
      frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but
      I was obliged to pay a hundred——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That will do—that will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these
      gentlemen all such domestic arrangements. You have the window, that is
      sufficient. Give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the stairs
      to conduct us to it.” The steward bowed, and was about to quit the
      room. “Ah,” continued the count, “be good enough to ask
      Pastrini if he has received the <i>tavoletta</i>, and if he can send us an
      account of the execution.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is no need to do that,” said Franz, taking out his
      tablets; “for I saw the account, and copied it down.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; but let us know when
      breakfast is ready. These gentlemen,” added he, turning to the two
      friends, “will, I trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, my dear count,” said Albert, “we shall abuse your
      kindness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure. You
      will, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris. M.
      Bertuccio, lay covers for three.” He then took Franz’s tablets
      out of his hand. “‘We announce,’ he read, in the same
      tone with which he would have read a newspaper, ‘that today, the 23d
      of February, will be executed Andrea Rondolo, guilty of murder on the
      person of the respected and venerated Don César Torlini, canon of the
      church of St. John Lateran, and Peppino, called Rocca Priori, convicted of
      complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa, and the men of his
      band.’ Hum! ‘The first will be <i>mazzolato</i>, the second <i>decapitato</i>.’
      Yes,” continued the count, “it was at first arranged in this
      way; but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order
      of the ceremony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really?” said Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosi’s, and
      there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For Andrea Rondolo?” asked Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the count, carelessly; “for the other (he
      glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name), for Peppino, called
      Rocca Priori. You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the
      <i>mazzuola</i> still remains, which is a very curious punishment when
      seen for the first time, and even the second, while the other, as you must
      know, is very simple. The <i>mandaïa</i> [*] never fails, never trembles,
      never strikes thirty times ineffectually, like the soldier who beheaded
      the Count of Chalais, and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless
      recommended the sufferer. Ah,” added the count, in a contemptuous
      tone, “do not tell me of European punishments, they are in the
      infancy, or rather the old age, of cruelty.”
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * Guillotine.
</pre>
    <p>
      “Really, count,” replied Franz, “one would think that
      you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are, at least, few that I have not seen,” said the
      count coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third
      curiosity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Curiosity—that is a terrible word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so? In life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not
      then, curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can
      part; and how, according to their different characters, temperaments, and
      even the different customs of their countries, different persons bear the
      transition from life to death, from existence to annihilation? As for
      myself, I can assure you of one thing,—the more men you see die, the
      easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be a
      torture, but it is not an expiation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not quite understand you,” replied Franz; “pray
      explain your meaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen,” said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face,
      as the blood would to the face of any other. “If a man had by
      unheard-of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother,
      your betrothed,—a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation,
      a wound that never closes, in your breast,—do you think the
      reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the
      knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal
      muscles of the murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral
      sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I know,” said Franz, “that human justice is
      insufficient to console us; she can give blood in return for blood, that
      is all; but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to
      grant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will put another case to you,” continued the count; “that
      where society, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death.
      But are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer
      without society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him even
      the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken? Are
      there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers of the
      Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are inadequate
      tortures, and which are unpunished by society? Answer me, do not these
      crimes exist?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” answered Franz; “and it is to punish them that
      duelling is tolerated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, duelling,” cried the count; “a pleasant manner,
      upon my soul, of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance! A man
      has carried off your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has
      dishonored your daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had
      the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness God has promised
      to everyone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you
      think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass a
      sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your
      brain, and despair in your heart. And remember, moreover, that it is often
      he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all crime in the
      eyes of the world. No, no,” continued the count, “had I to
      avenge myself, it is not thus I would take revenge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you disapprove of duelling? You would not fight a duel?”
      asked Albert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” replied the count; “understand me, I would
      fight a duel for a trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so
      that, thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to
      danger I have gradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my
      man. Oh, I would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow,
      profound, eternal torture, I would give back the same, were it possible;
      an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the Orientalists say,—our
      masters in everything,—those favored creatures who have formed for
      themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Franz to the count, “with this theory, which
      renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be
      difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under
      the power of the law. Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who
      pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and
      skilful; besides, the worst that could happen to him would be the
      punishment of which we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic
      French Revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or
      broken on the wheel. What matters this punishment, as long as he is
      avenged? On my word, I almost regret that in all probability this
      miserable Peppino will not be beheaded, as you might have had an
      opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and
      whether it is worth even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular
      conversation for the Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise? Ah, I
      recollect, you asked for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let
      us first sit down to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that
      breakfast is ready.” As he spoke, a servant opened one of the four
      doors of the apartment, saying—“<i>Al suo commodo!</i>”
      The two young men arose and entered the breakfast-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz looked
      repeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which he doubted
      not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but whether
      with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him,
      whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to
      duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which Franz knew of had
      had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did not pay
      the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who for the
      last four or five months had been condemned to partake of Italian cookery—that
      is, the worst in the world. As for the count, he just touched the dishes;
      he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests,
      and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more
      delicate food. This brought back to Franz, in spite of himself, the
      recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the Countess
      G——, and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box
      was a vampire. At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch.
      “Well,” said the count, “what are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must excuse us, count,” returned Franz, “but we
      have still much to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What may that be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private
      room in the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose
      brought to us, and you can dress there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “After the execution?” cried Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before or after, whichever you please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Opposite the scaffold?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The scaffold forms part of the <i>fête</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count, I have reflected on the matter,” said Franz, “I
      thank you for your courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a
      place in your carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I
      leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,” returned
      the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will describe it to me,” replied Franz, “and the
      recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had
      witnessed it. I have more than once intended witnessing an execution, but
      I have never been able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I,” replied the viscount,—“I saw Castaing
      executed, but I think I was rather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted
      college the same morning, and we had passed the previous night at a
      tavern.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at
      Paris, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it is
      to see everything. Think what a figure you will make when you are asked,
      ‘How do they execute at Rome?’ and you reply, ‘I do not
      know!’ And, besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous
      scoundrel, who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought
      him up like his own son. <i>Diable!</i> when a churchman is killed, it
      should be with a different weapon than a log, especially when he has
      behaved like a father. If you went to Spain, would you not see the
      bull-fight? Well, suppose it is a bull-fight you are going to see?
      Recollect the ancient Romans of the Circus, and the sports where they
      killed three hundred lions and a hundred men. Think of the eighty thousand
      applauding spectators, the sage matrons who took their daughters, and the
      charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal
      sign that said, ‘Come, despatch the dying.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall you go, then, Albert?” asked Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the count’s
      eloquence decides me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us go, then,” said Franz, “since you wish it; but
      on our way to the Piazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso. Is
      this possible, count?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On foot, yes, in a carriage, no.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will go on foot, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it important that you should go that way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, there is something I wish to see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, we will go by the Corso. We will send the carriage to wait
      for us on the Piazza del Popolo, by the Via del Babuino, for I shall be
      glad to pass, myself, through the Corso, to see if some orders I have
      given have been executed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excellency,” said a servant, opening the door, “a man
      in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes” returned the count, “I know who he is,
      gentlemen; will you return to the salon? you will find good cigars on the
      centre table. I will be with you directly.” The young men rose and
      returned into the salon, while the count, again apologizing, left by
      another door. Albert, who was a great smoker, and who had considered it no
      small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Café de Paris,
      approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some
      veritable <i>puros</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” asked Franz, “what think you of the Count of
      Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do I think?” said Albert, evidently surprised at such a
      question from his companion; “I think he is a delightful fellow, who
      does the honors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much,
      is, like Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,” added he,
      sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling, “that he has
      excellent cigars.” Such was Albert’s opinion of the count, and
      as Franz well knew that Albert professed never to form an opinion except
      upon long reflection, he made no attempt to change it. “But,”
      said he, “did you observe one very singular thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How attentively he looked at you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert reflected. “Ah,” replied he, sighing, “that is
      not very surprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and
      my clothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a
      provincial. The first opportunity you have, undeceive him, I beg, and tell
      him I am nothing of the kind.” Franz smiled; an instant after the
      count entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am now quite at your service, gentlemen,” said he. “The
      carriage is going one way to the Piazza del Popolo, and we will go
      another; and, if you please, by the Corso. Take some more of these cigars,
      M. de Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With all my heart,” returned Albert; “Italian cigars
      are horrible. When you come to Paris, I will return all this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will not refuse; I intend going there soon, and since you allow
      me, I will pay you a visit. Come, we have not any time to lose, it is
      half-past twelve—let us set off.” All three descended; the
      coachman received his master’s orders, and drove down the Via del
      Babuino. While the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza di Spagna and
      the Via Frattina, which led directly between the Fiano and Rospoli
      palaces, Franz’s attention was directed towards the windows of that
      last palace, for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the
      man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant. “Which are your
      windows?” asked he of the count, with as much indifference as he
      could assume. “The three last,” returned he, with a negligence
      evidently unaffected, for he could not imagine with what intention the
      question was put. Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows. The
      side windows were hung with yellow damask, and the centre one with white
      damask and a red cross. The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the
      Transteverin, and there could now be no doubt that he was the count. The
      three windows were still untenanted. Preparations were making on every
      side; chairs were placed, scaffolds were raised, and windows were hung
      with flags. The masks could not appear; the carriages could not move
      about; but the masks were visible behind the windows, the carriages, and
      the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz, Albert, and the count continued to descend the Corso. As they
      approached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became more dense, and above
      the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk,
      surmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in front
      of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del Babuino, del
      Corso, and di Ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the scaffold, between
      which glittered the curved knife of the <i>mandaïa</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of the street they met the count’s steward, who was
      awaiting his master. The window, let at an exorbitant price, which the
      count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests, was on the second
      floor of the great palace, situated between the Via del Babuino and the
      Monte Pincio. It consisted, as we have said, of a small dressing-room,
      opening into a bedroom, and, when the door of communication was shut, the
      inmates were quite alone. On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes
      of blue and white satin. “As you left the choice of your costumes to
      me,” said the count to the two friends, “I have had these
      brought, as they will be the most worn this year; and they are most
      suitable, on account of the <i>confetti</i> (sweetmeats), as they do not
      show the flour.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did not
      fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was wholly
      absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented, and by the
      terrible instrument that was in the centre. It was the first time Franz
      had ever seen a guillotine,—we say guillotine, because the Roman <i>mandaïa</i>
      is formed on almost the same model as the French instrument. [*] The
      knife, which is shaped like a crescent, that cuts with the convex side,
      falls from a less height, and that is all the difference. Two men, seated
      on the movable plank on which the victim is laid, were eating their
      breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal. Their repast consisted
      apparently of bread and sausages. One of them lifted the plank, took out a
      flask of wine, drank some, and then passed it to his companion. These two
      men were the executioner’s assistants. At this sight Franz felt the
      perspiration start forth upon his brow. The prisoners, transported the
      previous evening from the Carcere Nuovo to the little church of Santa
      Maria del Popolo, had passed the night, each accompanied by two priests,
      in a chapel closed by a grating, before which were two sentinels, who were
      relieved at intervals. A double line of carbineers, placed on each side of
      the door of the church, reached to the scaffold, and formed a circle
      around it, leaving a path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a
      space of nearly a hundred feet. All the rest of the square was paved with
      heads. Many women held their infants on their shoulders, and thus the
      children had the best view. The Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre
      filled with spectators; the balconies of the two churches at the corner of
      the Via del Babuino and the Via di Ripetta were crammed; the steps even
      seemed a parti-colored sea, that was impelled towards the portico; every
      niche in the wall held its living statue. What the count said was true—the
      most curious spectacle in life is that of death. And yet, instead of the
      silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion, laughter and jests
      arose from the crowd. It was evident that the execution was, in the eyes
      of the people, only the commencement of the Carnival. Suddenly the tumult
      ceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church opened. A brotherhood
      of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth, with
      holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands lighted tapers, appeared
      first; the chief marched at the head.

    <p>
      Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions. He was
      naked, with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung
      a large knife in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron
      sledge-hammer. This man was the executioner. He had, moreover, sandals
      bound on his feet by cords. Behind the executioner came, in the order in
      which they were to die, first Peppino and then Andrea. Each was
      accompanied by two priests. Neither had his eyes bandaged. Peppino walked
      with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him. Andrea was
      supported by two priests. Each of them, from time to time, kissed the
      crucifix a confessor held out to them. At this sight alone Franz felt his
      legs tremble under him. He looked at Albert—he was as white as his
      shirt, and mechanically cast away his cigar, although he had not half
      smoked it. The count alone seemed unmoved—nay, more, a slight color
      seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks. His nostrils dilated like
      those of a wild beast that scents its prey, and his lips, half opened,
      disclosed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal. And yet
      his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness, such as Franz had
      never before witnessed in them; his black eyes especially were full of
      kindness and pity. However, the two culprits advanced, and as they
      approached their faces became visible. Peppino was a handsome young man of
      four or five and twenty, bronzed by the sun; he carried his head erect,
      and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear.
      Andrea was short and fat; his visage, marked with brutal cruelty, did not
      indicate age; he might be thirty. In prison he had suffered his beard to
      grow; his head fell on his shoulder, his legs bent beneath him, and his
      movements were apparently automatic and unconscious.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * Dr. Guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from
     witnessing an execution in Italy.
</pre>
    <p>
      “I thought,” said Franz to the count, “that you told me
      there would be but one execution.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you true,” replied he coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet here are two culprits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many
      years to live.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And see, here it is,” said the count. At the moment when
      Peppino reached the foot of the <i>mandaïa</i>, a priest arrived in some
      haste, forced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of
      the brotherhood, gave him a folded paper. The piercing eye of Peppino had
      noticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his hand,
      “Heaven be praised, and his holiness also,” said he in a loud
      voice; “here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A pardon!” cried the people with one voice—“a
      pardon!” At this cry Andrea raised his head. “Pardon for whom?”
      cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peppino remained breathless. “A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca
      Priori,” said the principal friar. And he passed the paper to the
      officer commanding the carbineers, who read and returned it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For Peppino!” cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor
      in which he had been plunged. “Why for him and not for me? We ought
      to die together. I was promised he should die with me. You have no right
      to put me to death alone. I will not die alone—I will not!”
      And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast, and
      striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands. The
      executioner made a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold
      and seized him. “What is going on?” asked Franz of the count;
      for, as all the talk was in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly
      understood it. “Do you not see?” returned the count, “that
      this human creature who is about to die is furious that his
      fellow-sufferer does not perish with him? and, were he able, he would
      rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the
      life he himself is about to be deprived of. Oh, man, man—race of
      crocodiles,” cried the count, extending his clenched hands towards
      the crowd, “how well do I recognize you there, and that at all times
      you are worthy of yourselves!” Meanwhile Andrea and the two
      executioners were struggling on the ground, and he kept exclaiming,
      “He ought to die!—he shall die!—I will not die alone!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look, look,” cried the count, seizing the young men’s
      hands—“look, for on my soul it is curious. Here is a man who
      had resigned himself to his fate, who was going to the scaffold to die—like
      a coward, it is true, but he was about to die without resistance. Do you
      know what gave him strength?—do you know what consoled him? It was,
      that another partook of his punishment—that another partook of his
      anguish—that another was to die before him. Lead two sheep to the
      butcher’s, two oxen to the slaughterhouse, and make one of them
      understand that his companion will not die; the sheep will bleat for
      pleasure, the ox will bellow with joy. But man—man, whom God created
      in his own image—man, upon whom God has laid his first, his sole
      commandment, to love his neighbor—man, to whom God has given a voice
      to express his thoughts—what is his first cry when he hears his
      fellow-man is saved? A blasphemy. Honor to man, this masterpiece of
      nature, this king of the creation!” And the count burst into a
      laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must have suffered horribly to be
      able thus to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the struggle still continued, and it was dreadful to witness. The
      two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold; the people all took part
      against Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, “Put him to death!
      put him to death!” Franz sprang back, but the count seized his arm,
      and held him before the window. “What are you doing?” said he.
      “Do you pity him? If you heard the cry of ‘Mad dog!’ you
      would take your gun—you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast,
      who, after all, was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog. And
      yet you pity a man who, without being bitten by one of his race, has yet
      murdered his benefactor; and who, now unable to kill anyone, because his
      hands are bound, wishes to see his companion in captivity perish. No, no—look,
      look!”

    </h5>
    <p>
      The recommendation was needless. Franz was fascinated by the horrible
      spectacle. The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold, and there,
      in spite of his struggles, his bites, and his cries, had forced him to his
      knees. During this time the executioner had raised his mace, and signed to
      them to get out of the way; the criminal strove to rise, but, ere he had
      time, the mace fell on his left temple. A dull and heavy sound was heard,
      and the man dropped like an ox on his face, and then turned over on his
      back. The executioner let fall his mace, drew his knife, and with one
      stroke opened his throat, and mounting on his stomach, stamped violently
      on it with his feet. At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half fainting,
      into a seat. Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the
      window-curtains. The count was erect and triumphant, like the Avenging
      Angel!

      Chapter 36. The Carnival at Rome
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Franz
      recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of water, of which,
      to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and the count, who was
      assuming his masquerade costume. He glanced mechanically towards the
      square—the scene was wholly changed; scaffold, executioners,
      victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained, full of noise and
      excitement. The bell of Monte Citorio, which only sounds on the pope’s
      decease and the opening of the Carnival, was ringing a joyous peal.
      “Well,” asked he of the count, “what has, then,
      happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing,” replied the count; “only, as you see, the
      Carnival has commenced. Make haste and dress yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact,” said Franz, “this horrible scene has passed
      away like a dream.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is but a dream, a nightmare, that has disturbed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, that I have suffered; but the culprit?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is a dream also; only he has remained asleep, while you have
      awakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Peppino—what has become of him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Peppino is a lad of sense, who, unlike most men, who are happy in
      proportion as they are noticed, was delighted to see that the general
      attention was directed towards his companion. He profited by this
      distraction to slip away among the crowd, without even thanking the worthy
      priests who accompanied him. Decidedly man is an ungrateful and
      egotistical animal. But dress yourself; see, M. de Morcerf sets you the
      example.” Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black
      trousers and varnished boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Albert,” said Franz, “do you feel much inclined
      to join the revels? Come, answer frankly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, no,” returned Albert. “But I am really
      glad to have seen such a sight; and I understand what the count said—that
      when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle, it is the
      only one that causes you any emotion.”

    <p>
      “Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can
      study character,” said the count; “on the steps of the
      scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life, and the
      real visage is disclosed. It must be allowed that Andrea was not very
      handsome, the hideous scoundrel! Come, dress yourselves, gentlemen, dress
      yourselves.” Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two
      companions’ example. He assumed his costume, and fastened on the
      mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face. Their toilet
      finished, they descended; the carriage awaited them at the door, filled
      with sweetmeats and bouquets. They fell into the line of carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken
      place. Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death, the Piazza del
      Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry. A crowd
      of masks flowed in from all sides, emerging from the doors, descending
      from the windows. From every street and every corner drove carriages
      filled with clowns, harlequins, dominoes, mummers, pantomimists,
      Transteverins, knights, and peasants, screaming, fighting, gesticulating,
      throwing eggs filled with flour, confetti, nosegays, attacking, with their
      sarcasms and their missiles, friends and foes, companions and strangers,
      indiscriminately, and no one took offence, or did anything but laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz and Albert were like men who, to drive away a violent sorrow, have
      recourse to wine, and who, as they drink and become intoxicated, feel a
      thick veil drawn between the past and the present. They saw, or rather
      continued to see, the image of what they had witnessed; but little by
      little the general vertigo seized them, and they felt themselves obliged
      to take part in the noise and confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage, and which,
      while it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust, pricked his
      neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred
      pins, incited him to join in the general combat, in which all the masks
      around him were engaged. He rose in his turn, and seizing handfuls of
      confetti and sweetmeats, with which the carriage was filled, cast them
      with all the force and skill he was master of.

    <p>
      The strife had fairly begun, and the recollection of what they had seen
      half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men’s
      minds, so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession
      they now beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Count of Monte Cristo, he had never for an instant shown any
      appearance of having been moved. Imagine the large and splendid Corso,
      bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces, with their
      balconies hung with carpets, and their windows with flags. At these
      balconies are three hundred thousand spectators—Romans, Italians,
      strangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth,
      wealth, and genius. Lovely women, yielding to the influence of the scene,
      bend over their balconies, or lean from their windows, and shower down
      confetti, which are returned by bouquets; the air seems darkened with the
      falling confetti and flying flowers. In the streets the lively crowd is
      dressed in the most fantastic costumes—gigantic cabbages walk
      gravely about, buffaloes’ heads bellow from men’s shoulders,
      dogs walk on their hind legs; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted,
      and, as in Callot’s Temptation of St. Anthony, a lovely face is
      exhibited, which we would fain follow, but from which we are separated by
      troops of fiends. This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the second turn, the count stopped the carriage, and requested
      permission to withdraw, leaving the vehicle at their disposal. Franz
      looked up—they were opposite the Rospoli Palace. At the centre
      window, the one hung with white damask with a red cross, was a blue
      domino, beneath which Franz’s imagination easily pictured the
      beautiful Greek of the Argentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen,” said the count, springing out, “when you
      are tired of being actors, and wish to become spectators of this scene,
      you know you have places at my windows. In the meantime, dispose of my
      coachman, my carriage, and my servants.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We have forgotten to mention, that the count’s coachman was attired
      in a bear-skin, exactly resembling Odry’s in <i>The Bear and the
      Pasha</i>; and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys,
      with spring masks, with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz thanked the count for his attention. As for Albert, he was busily
      occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was
      passing near him. Unfortunately for him, the line of carriages moved on
      again, and while he descended the Piazza del Popolo, the other ascended
      towards the Palazzo di Venezia.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my dear fellow,” said he to Franz; “you did not
      see?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There,—that calash filled with Roman peasants.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I am convinced they are all charming women.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How unfortunate that you were masked, Albert,” said Franz;
      “here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” replied he, half laughing, half serious; “I hope
      the Carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in spite of Albert’s hope, the day passed unmarked by any
      incident, excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of
      Roman peasants. At one of these encounters, accidentally or purposely,
      Albert’s mask fell off. He instantly rose and cast the remainder of
      the bouquets into the carriage. Doubtless one of the charming females
      Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his
      gallantry; for, as the carriage of the two friends passed her, she threw a
      bunch of violets. Albert seized it, and as Franz had no reason to suppose
      it was meant for him, he suffered Albert to retain it. Albert placed it in
      his button-hole, and the carriage went triumphantly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Franz to him; “there is the beginning of an
      adventure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Laugh if you please—I really think so. So I will not abandon
      this bouquet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu</i>,” returned Franz, laughing, “in token of
      your ingratitude.” The jest, however, soon appeared to become
      earnest; for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the
      <i>contadini</i>, the one who had thrown the violets to Albert, clapped
      her hands when she beheld them in his button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo, bravo,” said Franz; “things go wonderfully.
      Shall I leave you? Perhaps you would prefer being alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied he; “I will not be caught like a fool at a
      first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock, as they say at the
      opera-balls. If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further, we
      shall find her, or rather, she will find us tomorrow; then she will give
      me some sign or other, and I shall know what I have to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On my word,” said Franz, “you are wise as Nestor and
      prudent as Ulysses, and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very
      powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was right; the fair unknown had resolved, doubtless, to carry the
      intrigue no farther; for although the young men made several more turns,
      they did not again see the calash, which had turned up one of the
      neighboring streets. Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace; but the
      count and the blue domino had also disappeared; the two windows, hung with
      yellow damask, were still occupied by the persons whom the count had
      invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the
      mascherata sounded the retreat. The file on the Corso broke the line, and
      in a second all the carriages had disappeared. Franz and Albert were
      opposite the Via delle Maratte; the coachman, without saying a word, drove
      up it, passed along the Piazza di Spagna and the Rospoli Palace and
      stopped at the door of the hotel. Signor Pastrini came to the door to
      receive his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz hastened to inquire after the count, and to express regret that he
      had not returned in sufficient time; but Pastrini reassured him by saying
      that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself,
      and that it had gone at four o’clock to fetch him from the Rospoli
      Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count had, moreover, charged him to offer the two friends the key of
      his box at the Argentina. Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions;
      but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the
      theatre; and instead of making any answer, he inquired if Signor Pastrini
      could procure him a tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A tailor,” said the host; “and for what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To make us between now and tomorrow two Roman peasant costumes,”
      returned Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To make you two costumes between now and tomorrow? I ask your
      excellencies’ pardon, but this is quite a French demand; for the
      next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six
      buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I must give up the idea?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; we have them ready-made. Leave all to me; and tomorrow, when
      you awake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be
      satisfied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Albert,” said Franz, “leave all to our host; he
      has already proved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly, and
      afterwards go and see <i>l’Italienne à Alger!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Agreed,” returned Albert; “but remember, Signor
      Pastrini, that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to
      having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their wishes
      should be attended to; upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their
      apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes.
      Albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the bunch of
      violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from
      remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristo’s table
      and that of Signor Pastrini. Truth compelled Franz, in spite of the
      dislike he seemed to have taken to the count, to confess that the
      advantage was not on Pastrini’s side. During dessert, the servant
      inquired at what time they wished for the carriage. Albert and Franz
      looked at each other, fearing really to abuse the count’s kindness.
      The servant understood them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had,” he said,
      “given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their
      lordships’ orders all day, and they could therefore dispose of it
      without fear of indiscretion.”
    </p>

    <p>
      They resolved to profit by the count’s courtesy, and ordered the
      horses to be harnessed, while they substituted evening dress for that
      which they had on, and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous
      combats they had sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      This precaution taken, they went to the theatre, and installed themselves
      in the count’s box. During the first act, the Countess G——
      entered. Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the
      previous evening, so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of
      the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to
      Franz. Her opera-glass was so fixedly directed towards them, that Franz
      saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity; and, availing himself
      of one of the privileges of the spectators of the Italian theatres, who
      use their boxes to hold receptions, the two friends went to pay their
      respects to the countess. Scarcely had they entered, when she motioned to
      Franz to assume the seat of honor. Albert, in his turn, sat behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said she, hardly giving Franz time to sit down,
      “it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the
      acquaintance of this new Lord Ruthven, and you are already the best
      friends in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without being so far advanced as that, my dear countess,”
      returned Franz, “I cannot deny that we have abused his good nature
      all day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All day?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; this morning we breakfasted with him; we rode in his carriage
      all day, and now we have taken possession of his box.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know him, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and no.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a long story.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell it to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would frighten you too much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the more reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least wait until the story has a conclusion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well; I prefer complete histories; but tell me how you made
      his acquaintance? Did anyone introduce you to him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; it was he who introduced himself to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Last night, after we left you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Through what medium?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The very prosaic one of our landlord.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is staying, then, at the Hôtel de Londres with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is his name—for, of course, you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Count of Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not a family name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, it is the name of the island he has purchased.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And he is a count?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Tuscan count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, we must put up with that,” said the countess, who was
      herself from one of the oldest Venetian families. “What sort of a
      man is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ask the Vicomte de Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You hear, M. de Morcerf, I am referred to you,” said the
      countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We should be very hard to please, madam,” returned Albert,
      “did we not think him delightful. A friend of ten years’
      standing could not have done more for us, or with a more perfect courtesy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” observed the countess, smiling, “I see my
      vampire is only some millionaire, who has taken the appearance of Lara in
      order to avoid being confounded with M. de Rothschild; and you have seen
      her?”

    <p>
      “Her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The beautiful Greek of yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; we heard, I think, the sound of her <i>guzla</i>, but she
      remained perfectly invisible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When you say invisible,” interrupted Albert, “it is
      only to keep up the mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the
      window with the white curtains?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where was this window with white hangings?” asked the
      countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the Rospoli Palace.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. Did you pass through the Corso?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask, and one
      with white damask with a red cross? Those were the count’s windows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, he must be a nabob. Do you know what those three windows were
      worth?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two or three hundred Roman crowns?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two or three thousand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deuce.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does his island produce him such a revenue?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It does not bring him a baiocco.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then why did he purchase it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For a whim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is an original, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In reality,” observed Albert, “he seemed to me somewhat
      eccentric; were he at Paris, and a frequenter of the theatres, I should
      say he was a poor devil literally mad. This morning he made two or three
      exits worthy of Didier or Anthony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a fresh visitor entered, and, according to custom, Franz
      gave up his seat to him. This circumstance had, moreover, the effect of
      changing the conversation; an hour afterwards the two friends returned to
      their hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the
      morrow; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied. The
      next morning, at nine o’clock, he entered Franz’s room,
      followed by a tailor, who had eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his
      arm; they selected two exactly alike, and charged the tailor to sew on
      each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon, and to procure them two
      of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders
      decorate themselves on fête days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress—a jacket
      and breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with
      buckles, and a silk waistcoat. This picturesque attire set him off to
      great advantage; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist, and
      when his hat, placed coquettishly on one side, let fall on his shoulder a
      stream of ribbons, Franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do
      with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations. The Turks used
      to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes, but are they not
      now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin, and their red
      caps, which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal? Franz
      complimented Albert, who looked at himself in the glass with an
      unequivocal smile of satisfaction. They were thus engaged when the Count
      of Monte Cristo entered.

    <p>
      “Gentlemen,” said he, “although a companion is
      agreeable, perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable. I come to
      say that today, and for the remainder of the Carnival, I leave the
      carriage entirely at your disposal. The host will tell you I have three or
      four more, so that you will not inconvenience me in any way. Make use of
      it, I pray you, for your pleasure or your business.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for
      refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them. The Count of Monte
      Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on all subjects
      with the greatest ease. He was, as we have already said, perfectly well
      acquainted with the literature of all countries. A glance at the walls of
      his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a connoisseur of
      pictures. A few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to
      the sciences, and he seemed much occupied with chemistry. The two friends
      did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them; it
      would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent
      table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini. They told him so frankly,
      and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their
      delicacy. Albert was charmed with the count’s manners, and he was
      only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of
      his varied knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above
      all, for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the
      preceding evening, and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing
      with them. At half-past one they descended, the coachman and footman had
      put on their livery over their disguises, which gave them a more
      ridiculous appearance than ever, and which gained them the applause of
      Franz and Albert. Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his
      button-hole. At the first sound of the bell they hastened into the Corso
      by the Via Vittoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carriage
      filled with harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and his
      friend, the peasants had changed their costume, also; and whether it was
      the result of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed them
      both, while he had changed his costume they had assumed his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole, but he kept the faded
      one in his hand; and when he again met the calash, he raised it to his
      lips, an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who
      had thrown it, but her joyous companions also. The day was as gay as the
      preceding one, perhaps even more animated and noisy; the count appeared
      for an instant at his window, but when they again passed he had
      disappeared. It is almost needless to say that the flirtation between
      Albert and the fair peasant continued all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, on his return, Franz found a letter from the embassy,
      informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his
      holiness the next day. At each previous visit he had made to Rome, he had
      solicited and obtained the same favor; and incited as much by a religious
      feeling as by gratitude, he was unwilling to quit the capital of the
      Christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of
      St. Peter’s successors who has set the rare example of all the
      virtues. He did not then think of the Carnival, for in spite of his
      condescension and touching kindness, one cannot incline one’s self
      without awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return from the Vatican, Franz carefully avoided the Corso; he
      brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts, to which the mad
      gayety of the maskers would have been profanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed. The harlequin had
      reassumed her peasant’s costume, and as she passed she raised her
      mask. She was charming. Franz congratulated Albert, who received his
      congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited. He
      had recognized by certain unmistakable signs, that his fair <i>incognita</i>
      belonged to the aristocracy. He had made up his mind to write to her the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz remarked, while he gave these details, that Albert seemed to have
      something to ask of him, but that he was unwilling to ask it. He insisted
      upon it, declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice
      the other wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required, and
      then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to
      occupy the carriage alone the next day. Albert attributed to Franz’s
      absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask.
      Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an
      adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so
      flattering to his vanity. He felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of
      his friend would duly inform him of all that happened; and as, during
      three years that he had travelled all over Italy, a similar piece of good
      fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz was by no means sorry to
      learn how to act on such an occasion. He therefore promised Albert that he
      would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival from the
      windows of the Rospoli Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormous
      bouquet, which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous
      epistle. This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet
      (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a charming
      harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was no longer joy, but delirium. Albert nothing doubted but
      that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner. Franz anticipated
      his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should pass
      the next day in writing and looking over his journal. Albert was not
      deceived, for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a
      folded paper which he held by one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said he, “was I mistaken?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She has answered you!” cried Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Read.” This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to
      describe. Franz took the letter, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tuesday evening, at seven o’clock, descend from your carriage
      opposite the Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches
      your torch from you. When you arrive at the first step of the church of
      San Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose-colored ribbons to the
      shoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be recognized.
      Until then you will not see me. —Constancy and Discretion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” asked he, when Franz had finished, “what do you
      think of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so, also,” replied Albert; “and I very much
      fear you will go alone to the Duke of Bracciano’s ball.” Franz
      and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated
      Roman banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take care, Albert,” said Franz. “All the nobility of
      Rome will be present, and if your fair <i>incognita</i> belong to the
      higher class of society, she must go there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,”
      returned Albert. “You have read the letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know how imperfectly the women of the <i>mezzo cito</i> are
      educated in Italy?” (This is the name of the lower class.)
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, read the letter again. Look at the writing, and find if you
      can, any blemish in the language or orthography.” (The writing was,
      in reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.) “You are
      born to good fortune,” said Franz, as he returned the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Laugh as much as you will,” replied Albert, “I am in
      love.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You alarm me,” cried Franz. “I see that I shall not
      only go alone to the Duke of Bracciano’s, but also return to
      Florence alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,” said
      Albert, “I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least. I adore
      Rome, and I have always had a great taste for archæology.”

    <p>
      “Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of
      seeing you a member of the Academy.” Doubtless Albert was about to
      discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed
      that dinner was ready. Albert’s love had not taken away his
      appetite. He hastened with Franz to seat himself, free to recommence the
      discussion after dinner. After dinner, the Count of Monte Cristo was
      announced. They had not seen him for two days. Signor Pastrini informed
      them that business had called him to Civita Vecchia. He had started the
      previous evening, and had only returned an hour since. He was charming.
      Whether he kept a watch over himself, or whether by accident he did not
      sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched,
      he was tonight like everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was an enigma to Franz. The count must feel sure that Franz
      recognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any
      previous acquaintance between them. On his side, however great Franz’s
      desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of being
      disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness
      prevented him from mentioning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the
      Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let. In consequence, he
      brought them the key of his own—at least such was the apparent
      motive of his visit. Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging their
      fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was going
      to the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if
      they did not profit by it. This assurance determined the two friends to
      accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count’s pallor, which
      had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting. He could not refrain
      from admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or
      rather the principal quality of which was the pallor. Truly, a Byronic
      hero! Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him
      without imagining his stern head upon Manfred’s shoulders, or
      beneath Lara’s helmet. His forehead was marked with the line that
      indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes
      that seem to penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful
      upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that
      impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed. The count
      was no longer young. He was at least forty; and yet it was easy to
      understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he
      associated at present. And, to complete his resemblance with the fantastic
      heroes of the English poet, the count seemed to have the power of
      fascination. Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in
      meeting such a man. Franz was less enthusiastic; but the count exercised
      over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind
      less domineering. He thought several times of the project the count had of
      visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that, with his eccentric
      character, his characteristic face, and his colossal fortune, he would
      produce a great effect there. And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when
      the count was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres; that is,
      not in listening to the music, but in paying visits and conversing. The
      Countess G—— wished to revive the subject of the count, but
      Franz announced he had something far newer to tell her, and, in spite of
      Albert’s demonstrations of false modesty, he informed the countess
      of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days. As
      similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may credit travellers,
      the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity, but congratulated
      Albert on his success. They promised, upon separating, to meet at the Duke
      of Bracciano’s ball, to which all Rome was invited. The heroine of
      the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign of her existence the
      morrow or the day after.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Tuesday came, the last and most tumultuous day of the Carnival.
      On Tuesday, the theatres open at ten o’clock in the morning, as Lent
      begins after eight at night. On Tuesday, all those who through want of
      money, time, or enthusiasm, have not been to see the Carnival before,
      mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise and excitement. From two
      o’clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the <i>fête</i>,
      exchanging handfuls of <i>confetti</i> with the other carriages and the
      pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horses’ feet and the carriage
      wheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight. The
      <i>fêtes</i> are veritable pleasure days to the Italians. The author of
      this history, who has resided five or six years in Italy, does not
      recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events
      so common in other countries. Albert was triumphant in his harlequin
      costume. A knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to
      the ground. In order that there might be no confusion, Franz wore his
      peasant’s costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day advanced, the tumult became greater. There was not on the
      pavement, in the carriages, at the windows, a single tongue that was
      silent, a single arm that did not move. It was a human storm, made up of a
      thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs, oranges, and
      nosegays.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o’clock the sound of fireworks, let off on the Piazza del
      Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid the din and
      confusion) announced that the races were about to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The races, like the <i>moccoli</i>, are one of the episodes peculiar to
      the last days of the Carnival. At the sound of the fireworks the carriages
      instantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets. All these
      evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous
      rapidity, without the police interfering in the matter. The pedestrians
      ranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and the
      clashing of steel were heard. A detachment of carbineers, fifteen abreast,
      galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the <i>barberi</i>. When
      the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia, a second volley of
      fireworks was discharged, to announce that the street was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly, in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry, seven
      or eight horses, excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand
      spectators, passed by like lightning. Then the Castle of Saint Angelo
      fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won. Immediately,
      without any other signal, the carriages moved on, flowing on towards the
      Corso, down all the streets, like torrents pent up for a while, which
      again flow into the parent river; and the immense stream again continued
      its course between its two granite banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd. The sellers of
      <i>moccoletti</i> entered on the scene. The <i>moccoli</i>, or <i>moccoletti</i>,
      are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight, and
      which give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival two very
      serious problems to grapple with,—first, how to keep his own <i>moccoletto</i>
      alight; and secondly, how to extinguish the <i>moccoletti</i> of others.
      The <i>moccoletto</i> is like life: man has found but one means of
      transmitting it, and that one comes from God. But he has discovered a
      thousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided him.
      The <i>moccoletto</i> is kindled by approaching it to a light. But who can
      describe the thousand means of extinguishing the <i>moccoletto</i>?—the
      gigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.
      Everyone hastened to purchase <i>moccoletti</i>—Franz and Albert
      among the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was rapidly approaching; and already, at the cry of “<i>Moccoletti</i>!”
      repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors, two or three stars
      began to burn among the crowd. It was a signal. At the end of ten minutes
      fifty thousand lights glittered, descending from the Palazzo di Venezia to
      the Piazza del Popolo, and mounting from the Piazzo del Popolo to the
      Palazzo di Venezia. It seemed like the <i>fête</i> of jack-o’-lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it. Suppose
      that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance
      on the face of the earth; the whole accompanied by cries that were never
      heard in any other part of the world. The <i>facchino</i> follows the
      prince, the Transteverin the citizen, everyone blowing, extinguishing,
      relighting. Had old Æolus appeared at this moment, he would have been
      proclaimed king of the <i>moccoli</i>, and Aquilo the heir-presumptive to
      the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours; the Corso was
      light as day; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth
      stories were visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every five minutes Albert took out his watch; at length it pointed to
      seven. The two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici. Albert sprang out,
      bearing his <i>moccoletto</i> in his hand. Two or three masks strove to
      knock his <i>moccoletto</i> out of his hand; but Albert, a first-rate
      pugilist, sent them rolling in the street, one after the other, and
      continued his course towards the church of San Giacomo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps were crowded with masks, who strove to snatch each other’s
      torches. Franz followed Albert with his eyes, and saw him mount the first
      step. Instantly a mask, wearing the well-known costume of a peasant woman,
      snatched his <i>moccoletto</i> from him without his offering any
      resistance. Franz was too far off to hear what they said; but, without
      doubt, nothing hostile passed, for he saw Albert disappear arm-in-arm with
      the peasant girl. He watched them pass through the crowd for some time,
      but at length he lost sight of them in the Via Macello. Suddenly the bell
      that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded, and at the same
      instant all the <i>moccoletti</i> were extinguished as if by enchantment.
      It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished
      everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz found himself in utter darkness. No sound was audible save that of
      the carriages that were carrying the maskers home; nothing was visible
      save a few lights that burnt behind the windows. The Carnival was over.

      Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n his whole life,
      perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression, so
      rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as in this moment. It seemed as
      though Rome, under the magic breath of some demon of the night, had
      suddenly changed into a vast tomb. By a chance, which added yet more to
      the intensity of the darkness, the moon, which was on the wane, did not
      rise until eleven o’clock, and the streets which the young man
      traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance was short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or
      rather the count’s, stopped before the Hôtel de Londres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was waiting, but as Albert had told him that he should not return
      so soon, Franz sat down without him. Signor Pastrini, who had been
      accustomed to see them dine together, inquired into the cause of his
      absence, but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous
      evening an invitation which he had accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden extinction of the <i>moccoletti</i>, the darkness which had
      replaced the light, and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil, had
      left in Franz’s mind a certain depression which was not free from
      uneasiness. He therefore dined very silently, in spite of the officious
      attention of his host, who presented himself two or three times to inquire
      if he wanted anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible. He ordered the
      carriage, therefore, for eleven o’clock, desiring Signor Pastrini to
      inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o’clock Albert had not come back. Franz dressed himself,
      and went out, telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the
      Duke of Bracciano’s. The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of
      the most delightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the
      Colonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus their
      <i>fêtes</i> have a European celebrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them, and
      their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his
      travelling companion. Franz replied that he had left him at the moment
      they were about to extinguish the <i>moccoli</i>, and that he had lost
      sight of him in the Via Macello.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then he has not returned?” said the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I waited for him until this hour,” replied Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you know whither he went?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a
      rendezvous.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Diavolo!</i>” said the duke, “this is a bad day, or
      rather a bad night, to be out late; is it not, countess!” These
      words were addressed to the Countess G——, who had just
      arrived, and was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia, the duke’s
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night,”
      replied the countess, “and those who are here will complain of but
      one thing—its too rapid flight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not speaking,” said the duke with a smile, “of the
      persons who are here; the men run no other danger than that of falling in
      love with you, and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so
      lovely; I meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” asked the countess, “who is out in the streets of
      Rome at this hour, unless it be to go to a ball?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of
      his unknown about seven o’clock this evening,” said Franz,
      “and whom I have not seen since.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And don’t you know where he is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is he armed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is in masquerade.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You should not have allowed him to go,” said the duke to
      Franz; “you, who know Rome better than he does.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You might as well have tried to stop number three of the <i>barberi</i>,
      who gained the prize in the race today,” replied Franz; “and
      then moreover, what could happen to him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who can tell? The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the
      Via Macello.” Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at
      observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in
      unison with his own personal disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the
      night here, duke,” said Franz, “and desired them to come and
      inform me of his return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” replied the duke, “here I think, is one of my
      servants who is seeking you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency,” he said, “the master of the Hôtel de
      Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a
      letter from the Viscount of Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A letter from the viscount!” exclaimed Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who is the man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why did he not bring it to me here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The messenger did not say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where is the messenger?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said the countess to Franz, “go with all speed—poor
      young man! Perhaps some accident has happened to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will hasten,” replied Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we see you again to give us any information?” inquired
      the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, if it is not any serious affair, otherwise I cannot answer as
      to what I may do myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be prudent, in any event,” said the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, pray be assured of that.” Franz took his hat and went
      away in haste. He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch
      him at two o’clock; fortunately the Palazzo Bracciano, which is on
      one side in the Corso, and on the other in the Square of the Holy
      Apostles, is hardly ten minutes’ walk from the Hôtel de Londres.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came near the hotel, Franz saw a man in the middle of the street. He
      had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert. The man was wrapped up
      in a large cloak. He went up to him, but, to his extreme astonishment, the
      stranger first addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What wants your excellency of me?” inquired the man,
      retreating a step or two, as if to keep on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are not you the person who brought me a letter,” inquired
      Franz, “from the Viscount of Morcerf?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency lodges at Pastrini’s hotel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency’s name——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is the Baron Franz d’Epinay.”

    <p>
      “Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there any answer?” inquired Franz, taking the letter from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—your friend at least hopes so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come upstairs with me, and I will give it to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I prefer waiting here,” said the messenger, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency will know when you have read the letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I find you here, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz entered the hotel. On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini. “Well?”
      said the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well—what?” responded Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your
      friend?” he asked of Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I have seen him,” he replied, “and he has handed
      this letter to me. Light the candles in my apartment, if you please.”
      The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light.
      The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed, and
      this had only made him the more anxious to read Albert’s letter; and
      so he went instantly towards the waxlight, and unfolded it. It was written
      and signed by Albert. Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what
      it contained. It was thus worded:—
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Fellow,—The moment you have received this, have the kindness
      to take the letter of credit from my pocket-book, which you will find in
      the square drawer of the <i>secrétaire</i>; add your own to it, if it be
      not sufficient. Run to Torlonia, draw from him instantly four thousand
      piastres, and give them to the bearer. It is urgent that I should have
      this money without delay. I do not say more, relying on you as you may
      rely on me. Your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert de Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.—I now believe in Italian <i>banditti</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below these lines were written, in a strange hand, the following in
      Italian:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non sono nelle mie
      mani, alla sette il Conte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luigi Vampa.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in
      my hands, by seven o’clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood
      the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the street
      was safer for him. Albert, then, had fallen into the hands of the famous
      bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to lose. He hastened to open the <i>secrétaire</i>, and
      found the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter of credit. There
      were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six thousand Albert had
      already expended three thousand. As to Franz, he had no letter of credit,
      as he lived at Florence, and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight
      days; he had brought but a hundred louis, and of these he had not more
      than fifty left. Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them
      both to make up the sum that Albert required. True, he might in such a
      case rely on the kindness of Signor Torlonia. He was, therefore, about to
      return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time, when suddenly a
      luminous idea crossed his mind. He remembered the Count of Monte Cristo.
      Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini, when that worthy presented
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear sir,” he said, hastily, “do you know if the
      count is within?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is he in bed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should say no.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind
      as to give me an audience.” Signor Pastrini did as he was desired,
      and returning five minutes after, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count awaits your excellency.”

      Franz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him to the count.
      He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and which was
      surrounded with divans. The count came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?” said he;
      “have you come to sup with me? It would be very kind of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A serious matter,” said the count, looking at Franz with the
      earnestness usual to him; “and what may it be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are we alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the count, going to the door, and returning.
      Franz gave him Albert’s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Read that,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well!” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you see the postscript?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>‘Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non
      sono nelle mie mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Luigi Vampa.‘”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What think you of that?” inquired Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you the money he demands?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, all but eight hundred piastres.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The count went to his <i>secrétaire</i>, opened it, and pulling out a
      drawer filled with gold, said to Franz, “I hope you will not offend
      me by applying to anyone but myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly,”
      replied Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I thank you; have what you will;” and he made a sign to
      Franz to take what he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?”
      asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Judge for yourself,” replied he. “The postscript is
      explicit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could
      find a way of simplifying the negotiation,” said Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?” returned the count, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not
      refuse you Albert’s freedom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be
      forgotten?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you not saved Peppino’s life?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well,” said the count, “who told you that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No matter; I know it.” The count knit his brows, and remained
      silent an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If my society would not be disagreeable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be it so. It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us
      both good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I take any arms?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For what purpose?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any money?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is useless. Where is the man who brought the letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the street.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He awaits the answer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must learn where we are going. I will summon him hither.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is useless; he would not come up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at
      entering mine.” The count went to the window of the apartment that
      looked on to the street, and whistled in a peculiar manner. The man in the
      mantle quitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street.
      “<i>Salite!</i>” said the count, in the same tone in which he
      would have given an order to his servant. The messenger obeyed without the
      least hesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a
      bound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, it is you, Peppino,” said the count. But Peppino, instead
      of answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the count’s hand,
      and covered it with kisses. “Ah,” said the count, “you
      have, then, not forgotten that I saved your life; that is strange, for it
      is a week ago.”

    <p>
      “No, excellency; and never shall I forget it,” returned
      Peppino, with an accent of profound gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never? That is a long time; but it is something that you believe
      so. Rise and answer.” Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz. “Oh,
      you may speak before his excellency,” said he; “he is one of
      my friends. You allow me to give you this title?” continued the
      count in French, “it is necessary to excite this man’s
      confidence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can speak before me,” said Franz; “I am a friend of
      the count’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good!” returned Peppino. “I am ready to answer any
      questions your excellency may address to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigi’s hands?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excellency, the Frenchman’s carriage passed several times the
      one in which was Teresa.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The chief’s mistress?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned it—all
      this with the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” cried Franz, “was Luigi Vampa in the carriage
      with the Roman peasants?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,” replied
      Peppino.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, the Frenchman took off his mask; Teresa, with the chief’s
      consent, did the same. The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous; Teresa gave
      him one—only, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who was on the steps
      of the church of San Giacomo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What!” exclaimed Franz, “the peasant girl who snatched
      his <i>mocoletto</i> from him——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was a lad of fifteen,” replied Peppino. “But it was no
      disgrace to your friend to have been deceived; Beppo has taken in plenty
      of others.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And Beppo led him outside the walls?” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello.
      Beppo got in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait to
      be asked twice. He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo, and sat
      by him. Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from
      Rome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the
      world. The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo;
      and when they were two hundred yards outside, as the Frenchman became
      somewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head, the
      coachman pulled up and did the same. At the same time, four of the band,
      who were concealed on the banks of the Almo, surrounded the carriage. The
      Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly strangled Beppo; but he could
      not resist five armed men, and was forced to yield. They made him get out,
      walk along the banks of the river, and then brought him to Teresa and
      Luigi, who were waiting for him in the catacombs of St. Sebastian.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said the count, turning towards Franz, “it seems
      to me that this is a very likely story. What do you say to it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, that I should think it very amusing,” replied Franz,
      “if it had happened to anyone but poor Albert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And, in truth, if you had not found me here,” said the count,
      “it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your
      friend dear; but now, be assured, his alarm will be the only serious
      consequence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And shall we go and find him?” inquired Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, decidedly, sir. He is in a very picturesque place—do you
      know the catacombs of St. Sebastian?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be
      difficult to contrive a better. Have you a carriage?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Always ready?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that
      sometimes when I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the night,
      I resolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go.” The
      count rang, and a footman appeared. “Order out the carriage,”
      he said, “and remove the pistols which are in the holsters. You need
      not awaken the coachman; Ali will drive.” In a very short time the
      noise of wheels was heard, and the carriage stopped at the door. The count
      took out his watch. “Half-past twelve,” he said. “We
      might start at five o’clock and be in time, but the delay may cause
      your friend to pass an uneasy night, and therefore we had better go with
      all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels. Are you still
      resolved to accompany me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “More determined than ever.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, come along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino. At the door
      they found the carriage. Ali was on the box, in whom Franz recognized the
      dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo. Franz and the count got into the
      carriage. Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and they set off at a rapid
      pace. Ali had received his instructions, and went down the Corso, crossed
      the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San Gregorio, and reached the gates
      of St. Sebastian. Then the porter raised some difficulties, but the Count
      of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the governor of Rome, allowing him
      to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night; the portcullis
      was therefore raised, the porter had a louis for his trouble, and they
      went on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way, and
      bordered with tombs. From time to time, by the light of the moon, which
      began to rise, Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear
      at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat into the darkness
      on a signal from Peppino.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage
      stopped, Peppino opened the door, and the count and Franz alighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In ten minutes,” said the count to his companion, “we
      shall be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He then took Peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and Peppino
      went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the carriage.
      Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a
      narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the
      Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage,
      which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said the count, “let us follow him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path,
      which, at the distance of a hundred paces, led them over a declivity to
      the bottom of a small valley. They then perceived two men conversing in
      the obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ought we to go on?” asked Franz of the count; “or shall
      we wait awhile?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.”
      One of the two men was Peppino, and the other a bandit on the lookout.
      Franz and the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them. “Your
      excellency,” said Peppino, addressing the count, “if you will
      follow me, the opening of the catacombs is close at hand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, then,” replied the count. They came to an opening
      behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a
      man could scarcely pass. Peppino glided first into this crevice; after
      they got along a few paces the passage widened. Peppino passed, lighted
      his torch, and turned to see if they came after him. The count first
      reached an open space and Franz followed him closely. The passageway
      sloped in a gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz and
      the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were
      scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another. They went on a hundred
      and fifty paces in this way, and then were stopped by, “Who comes
      there?” At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a
      carbine barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A friend!” responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards
      the sentry, he said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like
      the first, saluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps. Franz and the count
      descended these, and found themselves in a mortuary chamber. Five
      corridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into
      niches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins,
      showed that they were at last in the catacombs. Down one of the corridors,
      whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of light were visible.
      The count laid his hand on Franz’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?” he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exceedingly,” replied Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come with me, then. Peppino, put out the torch.” Peppino
      obeyed, and Franz and the count were in utter darkness, except that fifty
      paces in advance of them a reddish glare, more evident since Peppino had
      put out his torch, was visible along the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      They advanced silently, the count guiding Franz as if he had the singular
      faculty of seeing in the dark. Franz himself, however, saw his way more
      plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light, which served in
      some manner as a guide. Three arcades were before them, and the middle one
      was used as a door. These arcades opened on one side into the corridor
      where the count and Franz were, and on the other into a large square
      chamber, entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this chamber were four stones, which had formerly served
      as an altar, as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them. A
      lamp, placed at the base of a pillar, lighted up with its pale and
      flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of
      the two visitors concealed in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column, and was reading
      with his back turned to the arcades, through the openings of which the
      new-comers contemplated him. This was the chief of the band, Luigi Vampa.
      Around him, and in groups, according to their fancy, lying in their
      mantles, or with their backs against a sort of stone bench, which went all
      round the columbarium, were to be seen twenty brigands or more, each
      having his carbine within reach. At the other end, silent, scarcely
      visible, and like a shadow, was a sentinel, who was walking up and down
      before a grotto, which was only distinguishable because in that spot the
      darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque
      tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be silent, and,
      ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium,
      entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced towards Vampa, who
      was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who comes there?” cried the sentinel, who was less
      abstracted, and who saw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief.
      At this challenge, Vampa rose quickly, drawing at the same moment a pistol
      from his girdle. In a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and
      twenty carbines were levelled at the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no muscle of
      his countenance disturbed, “well, my dear Vampa, it appears to me
      that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Ground arms,” exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of
      the hand, while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then,
      turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said,
      “Your pardon, your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the
      honor of a visit, that I did not really recognize you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,”
      said the count, “and that not only do you forget people’s
      faces, but also the conditions you make with them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?” inquired
      the bandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is
      anxious to repair it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was it not agreed,” asked the count, “that not only my
      person, but also that of my friends, should be respected by you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Vicomte
      Albert de Morcerf. Well,” continued the count, in a tone that made
      Franz shudder, “this young gentleman is one of <i>my friends</i>—this
      young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself—this young
      gentleman has been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private
      carriage, and yet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed
      him hither, and,” added the count, taking the letter from his
      pocket, “you have set a ransom on him, as if he were an utter
      stranger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why did you not tell me all this—you?” inquired the
      brigand chief, turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look.
      “Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman
      like the count, who has all our lives in his hands? By heavens, if I
      thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his
      excellency, I would blow his brains out with my own hand!”

    <p>
      “Well,” said the count, turning towards Franz, “I told
      you there was some mistake in this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you not alone?” asked Vampa with uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom
      I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your
      excellency,” the count added, turning to Franz, “here is Luigi
      Vampa, who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he
      has committed.” Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps
      to meet him.
    </p>

      “Welcome among us, your excellency,” he said to him; “you
      heard what the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would
      not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend’s
      ransom, that this had happened.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Franz, looking round him uneasily, “where is
      the Viscount?—I do not see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing has happened to him, I hope,” said the count
      frowningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The prisoner is there,” replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow
      space in front of which the bandit was on guard, “and I will go
      myself and tell him he is free.” The chief went towards the place he
      had pointed out as Albert’s prison, and Franz and the count followed
      him. “What is the prisoner doing?” inquired Vampa of the
      sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, captain,” replied the sentry, “I do not
      know; for the last hour I have not heard him stir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in, your excellency,” said Vampa. The count and Franz
      ascended seven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and
      opened a door. Then, by the gleam of a lamp, similar to that which lighted
      the columbarium, Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of
      the bandits had lent him, lying in a corner in profound slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile,
      “not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o’clock
      tomorrow morning.” Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration;
      he was not insensible to such a proof of courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, your excellency,” he said; “this must be
      one of your friends.” Then going to Albert, he touched him on the
      shoulder, saying, “Will your excellency please to awaken?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes.
      “Oh,” said he, “is it you, captain? You should have
      allowed me to sleep. I had such a delightful dream. I was dancing the
      galop at Torlonia’s with the Countess G——.” Then
      he drew his watch from his pocket, that he might see how time sped.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Half-past one only?” said he. “Why the devil do you
      rouse me at this hour?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To tell you that you are free, your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow,” replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind,
      “remember, for the future, Napoleon’s maxim, ‘Never
      awaken me but for bad news;’ if you had let me sleep on, I should
      have finished my galop, and have been grateful to you all my life. So,
      then, they have paid my ransom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, how am I free?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come hither?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, hither.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really? Then that person is a most amiable person.” Albert
      looked around and perceived Franz. “What,” said he, “is
      it you, my dear Franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, not I,” replied Franz, “but our neighbor, the Count
      of Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, my dear count,” said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat
      and wristbands, “you are really most kind, and I hope you will
      consider me as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for
      the carriage, and in the next for this visit,” and he put out his
      hand to the Count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless
      did give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently accustomed
      to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was one whose gay
      temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz, he was enchanted
      at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in the
      presence of the bandit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Albert,” he said, “if you will make haste, we
      shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlonia’s. You may
      conclude your interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to
      Signor Luigi, who has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a
      gentleman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two o’clock.
      Signor Luigi,” continued Albert, “is there any formality to
      fulfil before I take leave of your excellency?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None, sir,” replied the bandit, “you are as free as
      air.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, a happy and merry life to you. Come, gentlemen, come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase,
      crossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Peppino,” said the brigand chief, “give me the torch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you going to do?” inquired the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will show you the way back myself,” said the captain;
      “that is the least honor that I can render to your excellency.”
      And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman, he preceded
      his guests, not as a servant who performs an act of civility, but like a
      king who precedes ambassadors. On reaching the door, he bowed. “And
      now, your excellency,” added he, “allow me to repeat my
      apologies, and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has
      occurred.”

    <p>
      “No, my dear Vampa,” replied the count; “besides, you
      compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way, that one almost
      feels obliged to you for having committed them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen,” added the chief, turning towards the young men,
      “perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you
      should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit, wherever I may be, you
      shall be welcome.” Franz and Albert bowed. The count went out first,
      then Albert. Franz paused for a moment. “Has your excellency
      anything to ask me?” said Vampa with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I have,” replied Franz; “I am curious to know what
      work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cæsar’s <i>Commentaries</i>,” said the bandit, “it
      is my favorite work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, are you coming?” asked Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Franz, “here I am,” and he, in his
      turn, left the caves. They advanced to the plain. “Ah, your pardon,”
      said Albert, turning round; “will you allow me, captain?” And
      he lighted his cigar at Vampa’s torch. “Now, my dear count,”
      he said, “let us on with all the speed we may. I am enormously
      anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Bracciano’s.” They
      found the carriage where they had left it. The count said a word in Arabic
      to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed. It was just two o’clock
      by Albert’s watch when the two friends entered into the
      dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they entered
      together, all uneasiness on Albert’s account ceased instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the
      countess, “yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a
      galop; I am rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my
      friend, whose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you
      the delay arose from no fault of mine.” And as at this moment the
      orchestra gave the signal for the waltz, Albert put his arm round the
      waist of the countess, and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers.
      In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had
      passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been, in
      some sort, forced to give his hand to Albert.

    <h2>
      Chapter 38. The Compact
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he first words
      that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following morning, contained a
      request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true, the
      young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous
      evening; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often
      acknowledged. Franz, who seemed attracted by some invisible influence
      towards the count, in which terror was strangely mingled, felt an extreme
      reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular
      fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him,
      and therefore made no objection to Albert’s request, but at once
      accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a short delay, the count
      joined them in the salon. “My dear count,” said Albert,
      advancing to meet him, “permit me to repeat the poor thanks I
      offered last night, and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe to
      you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me, as long as I live, I
      shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and
      important service you rendered me; and also to remember that to you I am
      indebted even for my life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My very good friend and excellent neighbor,” replied the
      count, with a smile, “you really exaggerate my trifling exertions.
      You owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been
      saved out of your travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a
      score between us;—but you must really permit me to congratulate you
      on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate,
      and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might
      take.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word,” said Albert, “I deserve no credit for
      what I could not help, namely, a determination to take everything as I
      found it, and to let those bandits see, that although men get into
      troublesome scrapes all over the world, there is no nation but the French
      that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself. All that, however,
      has nothing to do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you
      whether, in my own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way
      serve you? My father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin,
      possesses considerable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid,
      and I unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my
      life is dear, at your disposal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur de Morcerf,” replied the count, “your offer,
      far from surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I
      accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;—nay,
      I will go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to
      ask a great favor at your hands.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, pray name it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am wholly a stranger to Paris—it is a city I have never yet
      seen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible,” exclaimed Albert, “that you have
      reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world?
      I can scarcely credit it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking
      that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to me
      in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all probability,
      I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty, as that of
      making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly
      celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have introduced me
      into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed no acquaintance
      there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So distinguished an individual as yourself,” cried Albert,
      “could scarcely have required an introduction.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I
      possess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in the
      speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in
      travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of
      dabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should
      present itself of carrying my wish into execution. Your offer, however,
      smooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de
      Morcerf” (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile),
      “whether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the
      doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or a
      native of Cochin-China?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,” answered Albert;
      “and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from
      my father summons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my
      dear Franz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing,
      and connected with the very cream of Parisian society.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Connected by marriage, you mean,” said Franz, laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, never mind how it is,” answered Albert, “it comes
      to the same thing in the end. Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I
      shall be quite a sober, staid father of a family! A most edifying
      representative I shall make of all the domestic virtues—don’t
      you think so? But as regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear
      count, I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you
      please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then it is settled,” said the count, “and I give you my
      solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to
      realize plans that I have long meditated.” Franz did not doubt that
      these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few
      words in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and while the Count was speaking the
      young man watched him closely, hoping to read something of his purpose in
      his face, but his countenance was inscrutable especially when, as in the
      present case, it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile. “But tell me
      now, count,” exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of having to
      chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; “tell me truly
      whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris is merely
      one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many
      in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built on the sand, is
      liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I pledge you my honor,” returned the count, “that I
      mean to do as I have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel
      me to visit Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When do you propose going thither?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks’ time, that
      is to say, as fast as I can get there!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay,” said the Count; “I will give you three months ere
      I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And in three months’ time,” said Albert, “you
      will be at my house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?”
      inquired the count; “only let me warn you that I am proverbial for
      my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Day for day, hour for hour,” said Albert; “that will
      suit me to a dot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So be it, then,” replied the count, and extending his hand
      towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, “today
      is the 21st of February;” and drawing out his watch, added, “it
      is exactly half-past ten o’clock. Now promise me to remember this,
      and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Capital,” exclaimed Albert; “your breakfast shall be
      waiting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where do you live?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. 27, Rue du Helder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you bachelor’s apartments there? I hope my coming will
      not put you to any inconvenience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I reside in my father’s house, but occupy a pavilion at the
      farther side of the courtyard, entirely separated from the main building.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quite sufficient,” replied the count, as, taking out his
      tablets, he wrote down “No. 27, Rue du Helder, 21st May, half-past
      ten in the morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now then,” said the count, returning his tablets to his
      pocket, “make yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece
      will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I see you again ere my departure?” asked Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That depends; when do you leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tomorrow evening, at five o’clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to
      Naples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday
      morning. And you, baron,” pursued the count, addressing Franz,
      “do you also depart tomorrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For France?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then we shall not meet in Paris?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I fear I shall not have that honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, since we must part,” said the count, holding out a hand
      to each of the young men, “allow me to wish you both a safe and
      pleasant journey.” It was the first time the hand of Franz had come
      in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him, and
      unconsciously he shuddered at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that
      of a corpse. “Let us understand each other,” said Albert;
      “it is agreed—is it not?—that you are to be at No. 27,
      in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning,
      and your word of honor passed for your punctuality?”

    <p>
      “The 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, Rue du Helder,
      No. 27,” replied the Count. The young men then rose, and bowing to
      the count, quitted the room. “What is the matter?” asked
      Albert of Franz, when they had returned to their own apartments; “you
      seem more than commonly thoughtful.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will confess to you, Albert,” replied Franz, “the
      count is a very singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet
      him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow,” exclaimed Albert, “what can there
      possibly be in that to excite uneasiness? Why, you must have lost your
      senses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whether I am in my senses or not,” answered Franz, “that
      is the way I feel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen to me, Franz,” said Albert; “I am glad that the
      occasion has presented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed
      how cold you are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other
      hand, has always been courtesy itself to us. Have you anything particular
      against him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Possibly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about
      to tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon your honor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then listen to me.” Franz then related to his friend the
      history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding
      a party of smugglers there, and the two Corsican bandits with them. He
      dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality
      he had received from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment
      in the grotto of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>. He recounted, with
      circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of the supper, the hashish,
      the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening, there remained no proof
      or trace of all these events, save the small yacht, seen in the distant
      horizon driving under full sail toward Porto-Vecchio. Then he detailed the
      conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum, between the count and
      Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit
      Peppino,—an engagement which, as our readers are aware, he most
      faithfully fulfilled. At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding
      night, and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not
      having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum
      required, and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque
      and satisfactory result that followed. Albert listened with the most
      profound attention. “Well,” said he, when Franz had concluded,
      “what do you find to object to in all you have related? The count is
      fond of travelling, and, being rich, possesses a vessel of his own. Go but
      to Portsmouth or Southampton, and you will find the harbors crowded with
      the yachts belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense, and
      have the same liking for this amusement. Now, by way of having a
      resting-place during his excursions, avoiding the wretched cookery—which
      has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months, while
      you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years,—and
      obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber, Monte Cristo has
      furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him; but, to
      prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government taking a fancy to his
      enchanted palace, and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally
      expected from so large an outlay of capital, he has wisely enough
      purchased the island, and taken its name. Just ask yourself, my good
      fellow, whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume
      the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters
      of?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Franz, “the Corsican bandits that were among
      the crew of his vessel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough. Nobody knows
      better than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or
      thieves, but purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive
      from their native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no
      disgrace or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go to
      Corsica, my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or
      prefect, should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to
      find them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire greatly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still,” persisted Franz, “I suppose you will allow that
      such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other
      motive than plunder when they seize your person. How do you explain the
      influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to
      that influence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its
      source; therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with
      outlaws, you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there
      may be in such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for my
      own idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for saving me
      4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more nor less than
      24,000 livres of our money—a sum at which, most assuredly, I should
      never have been estimated in France, proving most indisputably,”
      added Albert with a laugh, “that no prophet is honored in his own
      country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Talking of countries,” replied Franz, “of what country
      is the count, what is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense
      fortune, and what were those events of his early life—a life as
      marvellous as unknown—that have tinctured his succeeding years with
      so dark and gloomy a misanthropy? Certainly these are questions that, in
      your place, I should like to have answered.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Franz,” replied Albert, “when, upon receipt of
      my letter, you found the necessity of asking the count’s assistance,
      you promptly went to him, saying, ‘My friend Albert de Morcerf is in
      danger; help me to deliver him.’ Was not that nearly what you said?”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “It was.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, did he ask you, ‘Who is M. Albert de Morcerf? how
      does he come by his name—his fortune? what are his means of
      existence? what is his birthplace? of what country is he a native?’
      Tell me, did he put all these questions to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I confess he asked me none.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa,
      where, I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and
      unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain. Now, then, Franz,
      when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks me
      in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince or
      Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris—merely to introduce him
      into society—would you have me refuse? My good fellow, you must have
      lost your senses to think it possible I could act with such cold-blooded
      policy.” And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the
      usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective
      arguments were all on Albert’s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Franz with a sigh, “do as you please my
      dear viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation.
      Still, in spite of all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is
      a most singular personage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a philanthropist,” answered the other; “and no
      doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize,
      given, as you are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most
      materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and
      interest can obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and
      promise the other. And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else.
      Come, shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter’s?”
      Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o’clock,
      the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and Franz d’Epinay
      to pass a fortnight at Venice. But, ere he entered his travelling
      carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might forget the
      engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a waiter at the
      hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which,
      beneath the name of Vicomte Albert de Morcerf, he had written in pencil:
    </p>
    <p>
      “27, <i>Rue du Helder, on the</i> 21<i>st May, half-past ten</i>

    <h2>
      Chapter 39. The Guests
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the house in the
      Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo,
      everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do
      honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at
      the corner of a large court, and directly opposite another building, in
      which were the servants’ apartments. Two windows only of the
      pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into the court, and
      two at the back into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the imperial
      architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and
      Countess of Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      A high wall surrounded the whole of the property, surmounted at intervals
      by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a large gate of
      gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance. A small door, close to
      the lodge of the <i>concierge</i>, gave ingress and egress to the servants
      and masters when they were on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling to
      part from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscount’s
      age required the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this habitation
      for Albert. There were not lacking, however, evidences of what we may call
      the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent,
      careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in a gilded cage.
      By means of the two windows looking into the street, Albert could see all
      that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men, who
      always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if that horizon
      is only a public thoroughfare. Then, should anything appear to merit a
      more minute examination, Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches
      by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the <i>concierge’s</i>
      door, and which merits a particular description.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the
      house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the
      well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. This door was a
      mockery to the <i>concierge</i>, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it
      was free, and, like that famous portal in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>,
      opening at the “<i>Sesame</i>” of Ali Baba, it was wont to
      swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from
      the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and which
      formed the antechamber, was, on the right, Albert’s breakfast-room,
      looking into the court, and on the left the salon, looking into the
      garden. Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from the
      garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as they
      were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third,
      formed out of the antechamber; these three rooms were a salon, a boudoir,
      and a bedroom. The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan, for the
      use of smokers. The boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by
      an invisible door on the staircase; it was evident that every precaution
      had been taken. Above this floor was a large <i>atelier</i>, which had
      been increased in size by pulling down the partitions—a pandemonium,
      in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were collected and piled up all Albert’s successive caprices,
      hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes—a whole orchestra, for Albert had
      had not a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes, pencils—for
      music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves, broadswords,
      and single-sticks—for, following the example of the fashionable
      young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with far more
      perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that complete a dandy’s
      education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick; and it was here that
      he received Grisier, Cook, and Charles Leboucher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old
      cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della
      Robbia <i>faïence</i>, and Palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which
      perhaps had sat Henry IV. or Sully, Louis XIII. or Richelieu—for two
      of these armchairs, adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved
      the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field, evidently came from the
      Louvre, or, at least, some royal residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed
      beneath Persia’s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of
      Calcutta or of Chandernagor. What these stuffs did there, it was
      impossible to say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination
      unknown to their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with
      their golden and silky reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet “baby grand”
      piano in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its
      narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i>
      of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, Grétry, and Porpora.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers, Malay
      creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of armor;
      dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame-colored wings
      outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open. This was
      Albert’s favorite lounging place.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established
      himself in the small salon downstairs. There, on a table, surrounded at
      some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco
      known,—from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai,
      and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,—was
      exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;
      beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their
      size and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an open
      cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their amber
      mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their long
      tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the
      symmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast of
      modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their
      mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom
      named John, and who only spoke English, all Albert’s establishment,
      although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great
      occasions the count’s <i>chasseur</i> also. This valet, whose name
      was Germain, and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master,
      held in one hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters,
      which he gave to Albert. Albert glanced carelessly at the different
      missives, selected two written in a small and delicate hand, and enclosed
      in scented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents with some
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did these letters come?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One by the post, Madame Danglars’ footman left the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in
      her box. Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera
      I will sup with her as she wishes. Take her six bottles of different wine—Cyprus,
      sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get them at Borel’s,
      and be sure you say they are for me.”

    <p>
      “At what o’clock, sir, do you breakfast?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What time is it now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A quarter to ten.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, at half past ten. Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go
      to the minister—and besides” (Albert looked at his tablets),
      “it is the hour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and
      though I do not much rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual. Is the
      countess up yet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you wish, I will inquire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, ask her for one of her <i>liqueur</i> cellarets, mine is
      incomplete; and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three
      o’clock, and that I request permission to introduce someone to her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet left the room. Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off the
      cover of two or three of the papers, looked at the theatre announcements,
      made a face seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet; hunted vainly
      amongst the advertisements for a new tooth-powder of which he had heard,
      and threw down, one after the other, the three leading papers of Paris,
      muttering,
    </p>
    <p>
      “These papers become more and more stupid every day.” A moment
      after, a carriage stopped before the door, and the servant announced M.
      Lucien Debray. A tall young man, with light hair, clear gray eyes, and
      thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved
      gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended
      by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and
      zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air,
      without smiling or speaking. “Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning,”
      said Albert; “your punctuality really alarms me. What do I say?
      punctuality! You, whom I expected last, you arrive at five minutes to ten,
      when the time fixed was half-past! Has the ministry resigned?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my dear fellow,” returned the young man, seating himself
      on the divan; “reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we
      never fall, and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of
      immobility, and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely
      consolidate us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans. We take him to
      the other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at
      Bourges.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At Bourges?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of
      Charles VII. Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day
      before it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do not
      know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we
      do) made a million!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your
      button-hole.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; they sent me the order of Charles III.,” returned
      Debray, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to
      have it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet. It looks very neat
      on a black coat buttoned up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of
      Reichstadt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is for that reason you see me so early.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to
      announce the good news to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, because I passed the night writing letters,—five and
      twenty despatches. I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but
      my head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour. At the Bois de
      Boulogne, <i>ennui</i> and hunger attacked me at once,—two enemies
      who rarely accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a
      sort of Carlo-republican alliance. I then recollected you gave a breakfast
      this morning, and here I am. I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is my duty as your host,” returned Albert, ringing the
      bell, while Lucien turned over, with his gold-mounted cane, the papers
      that lay on the table. “Germain, a glass of sherry and a biscuit. In
      the meantime, my dear Lucien, here are cigars—contraband, of course—try
      them, and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us
      with cabbage leaves.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Peste!</i> I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come
      from government you would find them execrable. Besides, that does not
      concern the home but the financial department. Address yourself to M.
      Humann, section of the indirect contributions, corridor A., No. 26.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On my word,” said Albert, “you astonish me by the
      extent of your knowledge. Take a cigar.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, my dear Albert,” replied Lucien, lighting a manilla
      at a rose-colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand—“how
      happy you are to have nothing to do. You do not know your own good
      fortune!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what would you do, my dear diplomatist,” replied Morcerf,
      with a slight degree of irony in his voice, “if you did nothing?
      What? private secretary to a minister, plunged at once into European
      cabals and Parisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to
      protect, parties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your
      cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his
      battle-fields with his sword and his victories; possessing five and twenty
      thousand francs a year, besides your place; a horse, for which
      Château-Renaud offered you four hundred louis, and which you would not
      part with; a tailor who never disappoints you; with the opera, the
      jockey-club, and other diversions, can you not amuse yourself? Well, I
      will amuse you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By introducing to you a new acquaintance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A man or a woman?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know so many men already.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you do not know this man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where does he come from—the end of the world?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Farther still, perhaps.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The deuce! I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no; our breakfast comes from my father’s kitchen. Are you
      hungry?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Humiliating as such a confession is, I am. But I dined at M. de
      Villefort’s, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners. You would
      think they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, depreciate other persons’ dinners; you ministers give
      such splendid ones.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but we do not invite people of fashion. If we were not forced
      to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with
      us, we should never dream of dining at home, I assure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Willingly. Your Spanish wine is excellent. You see we were quite
      right to pacify that country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but Don Carlos?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will
      marry his son to the little queen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will then obtain the Golden Fleece, if you are still in the
      ministry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke
      this morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but I
      hear Beauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will
      pass away the time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “About what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “About the papers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear friend,” said Lucien with an air of sovereign
      contempt, “do I ever read the papers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you will dispute the more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Beauchamp,” announced the servant. “Come in, come
      in,” said Albert, rising and advancing to meet the young man.
      “Here is Debray, who detests you without reading you, so he says.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is quite right,” returned Beauchamp; “for I
      criticise him without knowing what he does. Good-day, commander!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you know that already,” said the private secretary,
      smiling and shaking hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what do they say of it in the world?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you
      ought to reap a little blue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come, that is not bad!” said Lucien. “Why do you
      not join our party, my dear Beauchamp? With your talents you would make
      your fortune in three or four years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a
      minister who will hold office for six months. My dear Albert, one word,
      for I must give poor Lucien a respite. Do we breakfast or dine? I must go
      to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they
      arrive we shall sit down to table.”

      Chapter 40. The Breakfast
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd what sort of
      persons do you expect to breakfast?” said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A gentleman, and a diplomatist.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three
      for the diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some
      strawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to the
      Chamber.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a
      Montmorency, and the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at
      eleven; in the meantime, follow Debray’s example, and take a glass
      of sherry and a biscuit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister
      is out of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this
      morning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and at
      his wife’s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of
      France. The devil take the constitutional government, and since we had our
      choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not run down M. Danglars’ speeches,” said Debray;
      “he votes for you, for he belongs to the opposition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu</i>, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting
      until you send him to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear friend,” said Albert to Beauchamp, “it is plain
      that the affairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of
      humor this morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a
      marriage between myself and Mlle. Eugénie Danglars; I cannot in
      conscience, therefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one
      day say to me, ‘Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, this marriage will never take place,” said Beauchamp.
      “The king has made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he
      cannot make him a gentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic
      to consent, for the paltry sum of two million francs, to a <i>mésalliance</i>.
      The Viscount of Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But two million francs make a nice little sum,” replied
      Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a
      railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to La Râpée.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind what he says, Morcerf,” said Debray, “do you
      marry her. You marry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does
      that matter? It is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it.
      You have seven martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you
      will still have four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly
      became King of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On my word, I think you are right, Lucien,” said Albert
      absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard—that
      is, he can be.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not say that, Debray,” returned Beauchamp, laughing,
      “for here is Château-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for
      paradoxes, will pass the sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor,
      through your body.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He will sully it then,” returned Lucien; “for I am low—very
      low.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, heavens,” cried Beauchamp, “the minister quotes
      Béranger, what shall we come to next?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Château-Renaud—M. Maximilian Morrel,” said the
      servant, announcing two fresh guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, then, to breakfast,” said Beauchamp; “for, if I
      remember, you told me you only expected two persons, Albert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Morrel,” muttered Albert—“Morrel—who is he?”
      But before he had finished, M. de Château-Renaud, a handsome young man of
      thirty, gentleman all over,—that is, with the figure of a Guiche and
      the wit of a Mortemart,—took Albert’s hand. “My dear
      Albert,” said he, “let me introduce to you M. Maximilian
      Morrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and what is more—however the
      man speaks for himself—my preserver. Salute my hero, viscount.”
      And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and
      dignified bearing, with large and open brow, piercing eyes, and black
      moustache, whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles, under
      circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten. A rich uniform,
      half French, half Oriental, set off his graceful and stalwart figure, and
      his broad chest was decorated with the order of the Legion of Honor. The
      young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness. “Monsieur,”
      said Albert with affectionate courtesy, “the count of Château-Renaud
      knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me; you are his
      friend, be ours also.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well said,” interrupted Château-Renaud; “and pray that,
      if you should ever be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you
      as he did for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What has he done?” asked Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, nothing worth speaking of,” said Morrel; “M. de
      Château-Renaud exaggerates.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not worth speaking of?” cried Château-Renaud; “life is
      not worth speaking of!—that is rather too philosophical, on my word,
      Morrel. It is very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me,
      who only did so once——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your
      life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On what occasion?” asked Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Beauchamp, my good fellow, you know I am starving,” said
      Debray: “do not set him off on some long story.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I do not prevent your sitting down to table,” replied
      Beauchamp, “Château-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen,” said Morcerf, “it is only a quarter past
      ten, and I expect someone else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true, a diplomatist!” observed Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Diplomat or not, I don’t know; I only know that he charged
      himself on my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to
      my satisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him
      knight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden
      Fleece and the Garter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, since we are not to sit down to table,” said Debray,
      “take a glass of sherry, and tell us all about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a road your ancestors have traced for you,” said Albert
      gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes? but I doubt that your object was like theirs—to rescue
      the Holy Sepulchre.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are quite right, Beauchamp,” observed the young
      aristocrat. “It was only to fight as an amateur. I cannot bear
      duelling ever since two seconds, whom I had chosen to arrange an affair,
      forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends, one whom you all
      know—poor Franz d’Epinay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true,” said Debray, “you did fight some time ago;
      about what?”

    <p>
      “The devil take me, if I remember,” returned Château-Renaud.
      “But I recollect perfectly one thing, that, being unwilling to let
      such talents as mine sleep, I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols
      that had been given to me. In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went
      from thence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the
      raising of the siege. I retreated with the rest, for eight and forty
      hours. I endured the rain during the day, and the cold during the night
      tolerably well, but the third morning my horse died of cold. Poor brute—accustomed
      to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable, the Arabian finds
      himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in Arabia.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s why you want to purchase my English horse,” said
      Debray, “you think he will bear the cold better.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were very much frightened, then?” asked Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, yes, and I had good reason to be so,” replied
      Château-Renaud. “I was retreating on foot, for my horse was dead.
      Six Arabs came up, full gallop, to cut off my head. I shot two with my
      double-barrelled gun, and two more with my pistols, but I was then
      disarmed, and two were still left; one seized me by the hair (that is why
      I now wear it so short, for no one knows what may happen), the other swung
      a yataghan, and I already felt the cold steel on my neck, when this
      gentleman whom you see here charged them, shot the one who held me by the
      hair, and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre. He had assigned
      himself the task of saving a man’s life that day; chance caused that
      man to be myself. When I am rich I will order a statue of Chance from
      Klagmann or Marochetti.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Morrel, smiling, “it was the 5th of
      September, the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously
      preserved; therefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to
      celebrate it by some——”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Heroic action,” interrupted Château-Renaud. “I was
      chosen. But that is not all—after rescuing me from the sword, he
      rescued me from the cold, not by sharing his cloak with me, like St.
      Martin, but by giving me the whole; then from hunger by sharing with me—guess
      what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Strasbourg pie?” asked Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty
      appetite. It was very hard.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The horse?” said Morcerf, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, the sacrifice,” returned Château-Renaud; “ask
      Debray if he would sacrifice his English steed for a stranger?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not for a stranger,” said Debray, “but for a friend I
      might, perhaps.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I divined that you would become mine, count,” replied Morrel;
      “besides, as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice
      or not, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the
      favors good fortune had on other days granted to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The history to which M. Morrel alludes,” continued
      Château-Renaud, “is an admirable one, which he will tell you some
      day when you are better acquainted with him; today let us fill our
      stomachs, and not our memories. What time do you breakfast, Albert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At half-past ten.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely?” asked Debray, taking out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you will give me five minutes’ grace,” replied
      Morcerf, “for I also expect a preserver.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of myself,” cried Morcerf; “<i>parbleu!</i> do you
      think I cannot be saved as well as anyone else, and that there are only
      Arabs who cut off heads? Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we
      shall have at table—at least, I hope so—two benefactors of
      humanity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What shall we do?” said Debray; “we have only one
      Monthyon prize.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve
      it,” said Beauchamp; “that is the way the Academy mostly
      escapes from the dilemma.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where does he come from?” asked Debray. “You have
      already answered the question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put
      it a second time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really,” said Albert, “I do not know; when I invited
      him three months ago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows
      where he may have gone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you think him capable of being exact?” demanded Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think him capable of everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, with the five minutes’ grace, we have only ten left.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg pardon,” interrupted Beauchamp; “are there any
      materials for an article in what you are going to tell us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and for a most curious one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning,
      and I must make up for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was at Rome during the last Carnival.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We know that,” said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are no bandits,” cried Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for
      I found them ugly enough to frighten me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, my dear Albert,” said Debray, “confess that your
      cook is behindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or
      Marennes, and that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the
      dish by a story. Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse
      you, and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one
      from beginning to end. The brigands had carried me off, and conducted me
      to a gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it,” said Château-Renaud; “I narrowly escaped
      catching a fever there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I did more than that,” replied Morcerf, “for I
      caught one. I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of
      4,000 Roman crowns—about 24,000 francs. Unfortunately, I had not
      above 1,500. I was at the end of my journey and of my credit. I wrote to
      Franz—and were he here he would confirm every word—I wrote
      then to Franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before
      six, at ten minutes past I should have gone to join the blessed saints and
      glorious martyrs in whose company I had the honor of being; and Signor
      Luigi Vampa, such was the name of the chief of these bandits, would have
      scrupulously kept his word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,” said
      Château-Renaud. “A man whose name is Franz d’Epinay or Albert
      de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to
      present to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing
      Andromeda.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, he is a man about my own size.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Armed to the teeth?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He had not even a knitting-needle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But he paid your ransom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He said two words to the chief and I was free.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And they apologized to him for having carried you off?” said
      Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, he is a second Ariosto.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is no Count of Monte Cristo” said Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not think so,” added Château-Renaud, with the air of a
      man who knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors
      possessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think I can assist your researches,” said Maximilian.
      “Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the
      old sailors my father employed—a grain of sand in the centre of the
      Mediterranean, an atom in the infinite.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely!” cried Albert. “Well, he of whom I speak is
      the lord and master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased
      the title of count somewhere in Tuscany.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is rich, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But that ought to be visible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what deceives you, Debray.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you read the <i>Arabian Nights</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a question!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if
      their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor
      fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the
      wealth of the Indies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which means?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those
      fishermen. He has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself
      Sinbad the Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?” asked Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but Franz has; for heaven’s sake, not a word of this
      before him. Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by
      mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet. Only he is
      not quite sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he
      had taken hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a
      row of statues.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say,—“Are you
      mad, or are you laughing at us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I also,” said Morrel thoughtfully, “have heard
      something like this from an old sailor named Penelon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” cried Albert, “it is very lucky that M. Morrel
      comes to aid me; you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to
      the labyrinth?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Albert,” said Debray, “what you tell us is so
      extraordinary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of
      them—they have no time. They are too much taken up with interfering
      in the affairs of their countrymen who travel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now you get angry, and attack our poor agents. How will you have
      them protect you? The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that
      now they have scarcely any. Will you be ambassador, Albert? I will send
      you to Constantinople.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali,
      the Sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You say very true,” responded Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Albert, “but this has nothing to do with the
      existence of the Count of Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu!</i> everyone exists.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves,
      a princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an
      Arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and Greek
      mistresses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you seen the Greek mistress?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have both seen and heard her. I saw her at the theatre, and heard
      her one morning when I breakfasted with the count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He eats, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must be a vampire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Laugh, if you will; the Countess G——, who knew Lord
      Ruthven, declared that the count was a vampire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, capital,” said Beauchamp. “For a man not connected
      with newspapers, here is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,”
      said Debray; “facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead,
      livid complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness
      unexceptionable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just so, Lucien,” returned Morcerf; “you have described
      him feature for feature. Yes, keen and cutting politeness. This man has
      often made me shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, I
      thought I should faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in
      which he spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the
      executioner and the culprit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your
      blood?” asked Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,
      surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birth-right?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,” said Morcerf,
      somewhat piqued. “When I look at you Parisians, idlers on the
      Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems
      to me we are not of the same race.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am highly flattered,” returned Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the same time,” added Château-Renaud, “your Count of
      Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow, always excepting his little
      arrangements with the Italian banditti.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are no Italian banditti,” said Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No vampire,” cried Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No Count of Monte Cristo” added Debray. “There is
      half-past ten striking, Albert.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,”
      continued Beauchamp. But the sound of the clock had not died away when
      Germain announced, “His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.”
      The involuntary start everyone gave proved how much Morcerf’s
      narrative had impressed them, and Albert himself could not wholly refrain
      from manifesting sudden emotion. He had not heard a carriage stop in the
      street, or steps in the antechamber; the door had itself opened
      noiselessly. The count appeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity, but
      the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his
      toilet. Every article of dress—hat, coat, gloves, and boots—was
      from the first makers. He seemed scarcely five and thirty. But what struck
      everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn.
      The count advanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and approached
      Albert, who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial
      manner. “Punctuality,” said Monte Cristo, “is the
      politeness of kings, according to one of your sovereigns, I think; but it
      is not the same with travellers. However, I hope you will excuse the two
      or three seconds I am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be
      accomplished without some trouble, and especially in France, where, it
      seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear count,” replied Albert, “I was announcing your
      visit to some of my friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the
      promise you did me the honor to make, and whom I now present to you. They
      are the Count of Château-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve
      peers, and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien
      Debray, private secretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp,
      an editor of a paper, and the terror of the French government, but of
      whom, in spite of his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in
      Italy, since his paper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel,
      captain of Spahis.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy,
      but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace forward,
      and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks. “You wear the
      uniform of the new French conquerors, monsieur,” said he; “it
      is a handsome uniform.” No one could have said what caused the count’s
      voice to vibrate so deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in
      general so clear, lustrous, and limpid when he pleased. “You have
      never seen our Africans, count?” said Albert. “Never,”
      replied the count, who was by this time perfectly master of himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest
      hearts in the whole army.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, M. de Morcerf,” interrupted Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me go on, captain. And we have just heard,” continued
      Albert, “of a new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although I
      have seen him today for the first time, I request you to allow me to
      introduce him as my friend.” At these words it was still possible to
      observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated look, changing color, and slight
      trembling of the eyelid that show emotion. “Ah, you have a noble
      heart,” said the count; “so much the better.” This
      exclamation, which corresponded to the count’s own thought rather
      than to what Albert was saying, surprised everybody, and especially
      Morrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder. But, at the same time, the
      intonation was so soft that, however strange the speech might seem, it was
      impossible to be offended at it. “Why should he doubt it?”
      said Beauchamp to Château-Renaud.
    </p>

    <p>
      “In reality,” replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic
      glance and his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was
      penetrable in Monte Cristo, “Albert has not deceived us, for the
      count is a most singular being. What say you, Morrel!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in
      spite of the singular remark he has made about me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen,” said Albert, “Germain informs me that
      breakfast is ready. My dear count, allow me to show you the way.”
      They passed silently into the breakfast-room, and everyone took his place.
      “Gentlemen,” said the count, seating himself, “permit me
      to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may
      commit. I am a stranger, and a stranger to such a degree, that this is the
      first time I have ever been at Paris. The French way of living is utterly
      unknown to me, and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern
      customs, which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian. I beg you,
      therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish, too Italian,
      or too Arabian. Now, then, let us breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With what an air he says all this,” muttered Beauchamp;
      “decidedly he is a great man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A great man in his own country,” added Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A great man in every country, M. Debray,” said
      Château-Renaud. The count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate
      guest. Albert remarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the
      Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential
      point. “My dear count,” said he, “I fear one thing, and
      that is, that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste
      as that of the Piazza di Spagna. I ought to have consulted you on the
      point, and have had some dishes prepared expressly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you know me better,” returned the count, smiling, “you
      would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself,
      who has successively lived on macaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla
      podrida at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, curry in India, and swallows’
      nests in China. I eat everywhere, and of everything, only I eat but
      little; and today, that you reproach me with my want of appetite, is my
      day of appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What,” cried all the guests, “you have not eaten for
      four and twenty hours?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the count; “I was forced to go out of my
      road to obtain some information near Nîmes, so that I was somewhat late,
      and therefore I did not choose to stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you ate in your carriage?” asked Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the
      courage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to
      eat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?” said Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have a recipe for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An infallible one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any
      food to eat, and rarely anything to drink.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “but, unfortunately, a recipe
      excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an
      army, which might not awake when it was needed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “May we inquire what is this recipe?” asked Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” returned Monte Cristo; “I make no secret of
      it. It is a mixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton
      in order to have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the East—that
      is, between the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed
      in equal proportions, and formed into pills. Ten minutes after one is
      taken, the effect is produced. Ask Baron Franz d’Epinay; I think he
      tasted them one day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Morcerf, “he said something about it to
      me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very
      incredulous, “you always carry this drug about you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Always.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?”
      continued Beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, monsieur,” returned the count; and he drew from his
      pocket a marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a
      golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored
      pellet about the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating
      odor. There were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain
      about a dozen. The casket passed around the table, but it was more to
      examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from
      hand to hand. “And is it your cook who prepares these pills?”
      asked Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo; “I do not thus
      betray my enjoyments to the vulgar. I am a tolerable chemist, and prepare
      my pills myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen,”
      said Château-Renaud, “although my mother has some remarkable family
      jewels.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had three similar ones,” returned Monte Cristo. “I
      gave one to the Sultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy
      father the Pope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as
      large, though not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his
      predecessor, Pius VII. I kept the third for myself, and I had it hollowed
      out, which reduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the
      purpose I intended.” Every one looked at Monte Cristo with
      astonishment; he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he
      spoke the truth, or that he was mad. However, the sight of the emerald
      made them naturally incline to the former belief. “And what did
      these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents?”
      asked Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Sultan, the liberty of a woman,” replied the Count;
      “the Pope, the life of a man; so that once in my life I have been as
      powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a
      throne.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it was Peppino you saved, was it not?” cried Morcerf;
      “it was for him that you obtained pardon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps,” returned the count, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear
      you speak thus,” said Morcerf. “I had announced you beforehand
      to my friends as an enchanter of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, a wizard of
      the Middle Ages; but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they
      mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths,
      when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence. For
      example, here is Debray who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day,
      ‘A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the
      Boulevard;’ ‘four persons have been assassinated in the Rue
      St. Denis’ or ‘the Faubourg St. Germain;’ ‘ten,
      fifteen, or twenty thieves, have been arrested in a <i>café</i> on the
      Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien,’—and yet
      these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma, the
      Campagna di Romana, or the Pontine Marshes. Tell them yourself that I was
      taken by bandits, and that without your generous intercession I should now
      have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, instead of receiving
      them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Monte Cristo “you promised me never to
      mention that circumstance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was not I who made that promise,” cried Morcerf; “it
      must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and
      whom you have forgotten. Pray speak of it, for I shall not only, I trust,
      relate the little I do know, but also a great deal I do not know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems to me,” returned the count, smiling, “that you
      played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what
      happened.”

      “Well,” said Morcerf, “for three days I believed myself
      the object of the attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of
      Tullia or Poppæa, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a <i>contadina</i>,
      and I say <i>contadina</i> to avoid saying peasant girl. What I know is,
      that, like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now, I
      mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a
      beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was about to imprint a
      chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by seven
      or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the Catacombs of St.
      Sebastian, where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing Cæsar’s
      <i>Commentaries</i>, and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me,
      that unless the next morning, before six o’clock, four thousand
      piastres were paid into his account at his banker’s, at a quarter
      past six I should have ceased to exist. The letter is still to be seen,
      for it is in Franz d’Epinay’s possession, signed by me, and
      with a postscript of M. Luigi Vampa. This is all I know, but I know not,
      count, how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome
      who ordinarily have so little respect for anything. I assure you, Franz
      and I were lost in admiration.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing more simple,” returned the count. “I had known
      the famous Vampa for more than ten years. When he was quite a child, and
      only a shepherd, I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and
      he, in order to repay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had
      carved with his own hand, and which you may have seen in my collection of
      arms. In after years, whether he had forgotten this interchange of
      presents, which ought to have cemented our friendship, or whether he did
      not recollect me, he sought to take me, but, on the contrary, it was I who
      captured him and a dozen of his band. I might have handed him over to
      Roman justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would have been
      particularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sort—I suffered
      him and his band to depart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With the condition that they should sin no more,” said
      Beauchamp, laughing. “I see they kept their promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo “upon the simple
      condition that they should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I
      am about to say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt
      humanity and your duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a
      society which does not protect me, and which I will even say, generally
      occupies itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low
      place in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is
      society and my neighbor who are indebted to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo,” cried Château-Renaud; “you are the first man I
      ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is frank, at least,” said Morrel. “But I am sure
      that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he
      has so boldly avowed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?” asked
      Monte Cristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,
      that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that
      clear and piercing glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, it seems to me,” replied Morrel, “that in
      delivering M. de Morcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your
      neighbor and to society.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of which he is the brightest ornament,” said Beauchamp,
      drinking off a glass of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear count,” cried Morcerf, “you are at fault—you,
      one of the most formidable logicians I know—and you must see it
      clearly proved that instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist.
      Ah, you call yourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese;
      your family name is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal
      appellation, and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively
      display the greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric
      Parisians,—that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal
      the virtues you possess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear vicomte,” returned Monte Cristo, “I do not see,
      in all I have done, anything that merits, either from you or these
      gentlemen, the pretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to
      me, for I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you
      to breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival
      in your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo
      the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted. I will
      appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of a
      hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had the idea that
      you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to
      France. You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a
      vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and you must submit to
      it under penalty of breaking your word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will keep it,” returned Morcerf; “but I fear that you
      will be much disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and
      fantastic horizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those
      episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you;
      our Chimborazo is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valérien, our Great
      Desert is the plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian
      well to water the caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so many
      as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than
      a lord. France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will
      not find in its eighty-five departments—I say eighty-five, because I
      do not include Corsica—you will not find, then, in these eighty-five
      departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto
      in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp. There is but
      one service I can render you, and for that I place myself entirely at your
      orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you everywhere;
      besides, you have no need of anyone to introduce you—with your name,
      and your fortune, and your talent” (Monte Cristo bowed with a
      somewhat ironical smile) “you can present yourself everywhere, and
      be well received. I can be useful in one way only—if knowledge of
      Parisian habits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the
      bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling
      here. I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as I shared
      yours at Rome—I, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist <i>par
      excellence</i>; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow
      more, unless that shadow were feminine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the count, “that is a most conjugal
      reservation; I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected
      marriage. May I congratulate you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The affair is still in projection.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And he who says in ‘projection,’ means already decided,”
      said Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Morcerf, “my father is most anxious about
      it; and I hope, ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to
      my betrothed—Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eugénie Danglars,” said Monte Cristo; “tell me, is not
      her father Baron Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” returned Morcerf, “a baron of a new creation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What matter,” said Monte Cristo “if he has rendered the
      State services which merit this distinction?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Enormous ones,” answered Beauchamp. “Although in
      reality a Liberal, he negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in
      1829, who made him a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that
      he wears the ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but
      at his button-hole.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” interrupted Morcerf, laughing, “Beauchamp,
      Beauchamp, keep that for the <i>Corsaire</i> or the <i>Charivari</i>, but
      spare my future father-in-law before me.” Then, turning to Monte
      Cristo, “You just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know him,” returned Monte Cristo; “but I shall
      probably soon make his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him
      by the house of Richard &amp; Blount, of London, Arstein &amp; Eskoles of
      Vienna, and Thomson &amp; French at Rome.” As he pronounced the two
      last names, the count glanced at Maximilian Morrel. If the stranger
      expected to produce an effect on Morrel, he was not mistaken—Maximilian
      started as if he had been electrified. “Thomson &amp; French,”
      said he; “do you know this house, monsieur?”

    <p>
      “They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world,”
      returned the count quietly. “Can my influence with them be of any
      service to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have
      been, up to the present, fruitless. This house, in past years, did ours a
      great service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied having
      rendered us this service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall be at your orders,” said Monte Cristo bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” continued Morcerf, “<i>à propos</i> of Danglars,—we
      have strangely wandered from the subject. We were speaking of a suitable
      habitation for the Count of Monte Cristo. Come, gentlemen, let us all
      propose some place. Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great
      capital?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Faubourg Saint-Germain,” said Château-Renaud. “The
      count will find there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah, Château-Renaud,” returned Debray, “you only know
      your dull and gloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to
      him, count—live in the Chaussée d’Antin, that’s the real
      centre of Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boulevard de l’Opéra,” said Beauchamp; “the
      second floor—a house with a balcony. The count will have his
      cushions of silver cloth brought there, and as he smokes his chibouque,
      see all Paris pass before him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have no idea, then, Morrel?” asked Château-Renaud;
      “you do not propose anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” returned the young man, smiling; “on the
      contrary, I have one, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of
      the brilliant proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of
      them, I will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming
      hotel, in the Pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in
      the Rue Meslay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have a sister?” asked the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Married?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nearly nine years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Happy?” asked the count again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,”
      replied Maximilian. “She married the man she loved, who remained
      faithful to us in our fallen fortunes—Emmanuel Herbaut.” Monte
      Cristo smiled imperceptibly. “I live there during my leave of
      absence,” continued Maximilian; “and I shall be, together with
      my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposition of the Count, whenever he
      thinks fit to honor us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One minute,” cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the
      time to reply. “Take care, you are going to immure a traveller,
      Sinbad the Sailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a
      patriarch of him.”

    <p>
      “Oh, no,” said Morrel; “my sister is five and twenty, my
      brother-in-law is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy. Besides, the
      count will be in his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do
      so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo; “I shall content
      myself with being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do
      me the honor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of
      these gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What,” cried Morcerf; “you are, then, going to a hotel—that
      will be very dull for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was I so badly lodged at Rome?” said Monte Cristo smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Parbleu!</i> at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in
      furnishing your apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to
      spend a similar sum every day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not that which deterred me,” replied Monte Cristo;
      “but as I determined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet
      de chambre, and he ought by this time to have bought the house and
      furnished it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?” said
      Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and
      cannot speak,” returned Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is Ali!” cried Albert, in the midst of the general
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly,” said Morcerf; “I recollect him perfectly.
      But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to
      furnish it?—he will do everything wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Undeceive yourself, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo; “I
      am quite sure, that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish.
      He knows my tastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with
      the instinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything
      for me. He knew, that I should arrive today at ten o’clock; he was
      waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de Fontainebleau. He gave me this
      paper; it contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,”
      and Monte Cristo passed a paper to Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is really original,” said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And very princely,” added Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, do you not know your house?” asked Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Monte Cristo; “I told you I did not wish to
      be behind my time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the
      viscount’s door.” The young men looked at each other; they did
      not know if it was a comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he
      uttered had such an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose
      what he said was false—besides, why should he tell a falsehood?
      “We must content ourselves, then,” said Beauchamp, “with
      rendering the count all the little services in our power. I, in my quality
      of journalist, open all the theatres to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo, “my steward
      has orders to take a box at each theatre.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is your steward also a Nubian?” asked Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of
      any one’s. But you know him, M. de Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows
      so well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has
      been a soldier, a smuggler—in fact, everything. I would not be quite
      sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle—a
      stab with a knife, for instance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,”
      said Debray. “Of how much does he rob you every year?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On my word,” replied the count, “not more than another.
      I am sure he answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” continued Château-Renaud, “since you have an
      establishment, a steward, and a hotel in the Champs-Élysées, you only want
      a mistress.” Albert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen
      in the count’s box at the Argentina and Valle theatres. “I
      have something better than that,” said Monte Cristo; “I have a
      slave. You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or the
      Variétés; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but I have
      nothing to fear.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you forget,” replied Debray, laughing, “that we are
      Franks by name and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the
      moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes free.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who will tell her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The first person who sees her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She only speaks Romaic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is different.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But at least we shall see her,” said Beauchamp, “or do
      you keep eunuchs as well as mutes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” replied Monte Cristo; “I do not carry
      brutalism so far. Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when
      they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for
      that reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.” They had long since
      passed to dessert and cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Albert,” said Debray, rising, “it is half-past
      two. Your guest is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the
      worst sometimes. I must return to the minister’s. I will tell him of
      the count, and we shall soon know who he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take care,” returned Albert; “no one has been able to
      accomplish that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are
      almost always spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty
      thousand francs to spend for this purpose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when you know, will you tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I promise you. <i>Au revoir</i>, Albert. Gentlemen, good morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left the room, Debray called out loudly, “My carriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo,” said Beauchamp to Albert; “I shall not go to
      the Chamber, but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech
      of M. Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For heaven’s sake, Beauchamp,” returned Morcerf,
      “do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere. Is he
      not peculiar?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is more than that,” replied Château-Renaud; “he is
      one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my life. Are you coming,
      Morrel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Directly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay
      us a visit at Rue Meslay, No. 14.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be sure I shall not fail to do so,” returned the count,
      bowing. And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de
      Château-Renaud, leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.

      Chapter 41. The Presentation
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Albert found
      himself alone with Monte Cristo, “My dear count,” said he,
      “allow me to commence my services as <i>cicerone</i> by showing you
      a specimen of a bachelor’s apartment. You, who are accustomed to the
      palaces of Italy, can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square
      feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live. As we pass
      from one room to another, I will open the windows to let you breathe.”
      Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfast-room and the salon on the
      ground floor. Albert led him first to his <i>atelier</i>, which was, as we
      have said, his favorite apartment. Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all
      that Albert had collected here—old cabinets, Japanese porcelain,
      Oriental stuffs, Venetian glass, arms from all parts of the world—everything
      was familiar to him; and at the first glance he recognized their date,
      their country, and their origin. Morcerf had expected he should be the
      guide; on the contrary, it was he who, under the count’s guidance,
      followed a course of archæology, mineralogy, and natural history. They
      descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest into the salon. The
      salon was filled with the works of modern artists; there were landscapes
      by Dupré, with their long reeds and tall trees, their lowing oxen and
      marvellous skies; Delacroix’s Arabian cavaliers, with their long
      white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their horses,
      who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely
      with their maces; <i>aquarelles</i> of Boulanger, representing Notre Dame
      de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet;
      there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his flowers more beautiful than
      flowers, his suns more brilliant than the sun; designs by Decamp, as
      vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa, but more poetic; <i>pastels</i>
      by Giraud and Müller, representing children like angels and women with the
      features of a virgin; sketches torn from the album of Dauzats’
      “Travels in the East,” that had been made in a few seconds on
      the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a mosque—in a word,
      all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art
      lost and gone with ages long since past.

      Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller,
      but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking for the
      signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named instantly the
      author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each
      name was not only known to him, but that each style associated with it had
      been appreciated and studied by him. From the salon they passed into the
      bedchamber; it was a model of taste and simple elegance. A single
      portrait, signed by Leopold Robert, shone in its carved and gilded frame.
      This portrait attracted the Count of Monte Cristo’s attention, for
      he made three rapid steps in the chamber, and stopped suddenly before it.
      It was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty, with a
      dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes, veiled beneath long lashes.
      She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen, a red and
      black bodice, and golden pins in her hair. She was looking at the sea, and
      her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky. The light was so faint in
      the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over
      the count’s visage, or the nervous heaving of his chest and
      shoulders. Silence prevailed for an instant, during which Monte Cristo
      gazed intently on the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have there a most charming mistress, viscount,” said the
      count in a perfectly calm tone; “and this costume—a ball
      costume, doubtless—becomes her admirably.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, monsieur,” returned Albert, “I would never forgive
      you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this. You do not
      know my mother; she it is whom you see here. She had her portrait painted
      thus six or eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and
      the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as
      she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during the count’s
      absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise; but,
      strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my father, and the value
      of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the best works of Leopold
      Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it. It is true, between
      ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the
      Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a most mediocre amateur of
      art. It is different with my mother, who paints exceedingly well, and who,
      unwilling to part with so valuable a picture, gave it to me to put here,
      where it would be less likely to displease M. de Morcerf, whose portrait,
      by Gros, I will also show you. Excuse my talking of family matters, but as
      I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count, I tell you this to
      prevent you making any allusions to this picture. The picture seems to
      have a malign influence, for my mother rarely comes here without looking
      at it, and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping. This
      disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count
      and countess, who are still as much united, although married more than
      twenty years, as on the first day of their wedding.”

      Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning in
      his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity
      of his heart. “Now,” said Albert, “that you have seen
      all my treasures, allow me to offer them to you, unworthy as they are.
      Consider yourself as in your own house, and to put yourself still more at
      your ease, pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf, he whom I
      wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me, and to whom I
      announced your promised visit, and I may say that both the count and
      countess anxiously desire to thank you in person. You are somewhat <i>blasé</i>
      I know, and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor, who
      has seen so many others. However, accept what I propose to you as an
      initiation into Parisian life—a life of politeness, visiting, and
      introductions.” Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer; he
      accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret, as one of those
      conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty. Albert
      summoned his servant, and ordered him to acquaint M. and Madame de Morcerf
      of the arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo. Albert followed him with the
      count. When they arrived at the antechamber, above the door was visible a
      shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the
      furniture, indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon.
      Monte Cristo stopped and examined it attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Azure seven merlets, or, placed bender,” said he. “These
      are, doubtless, your family arms? Except the knowledge of blazons, that
      enables me to decipher them, I am very ignorant of heraldry—I, a
      count of a fresh creation, fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a
      commandery of St. Stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had I
      not been told that when you travel much it is necessary. Besides, you must
      have something on the panels of your carriage, to escape being searched by
      the custom-house officers. Excuse my putting such a question to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not indiscreet,” returned Morcerf, with the simplicity
      of conviction. “You have guessed rightly. These are our arms, that
      is, those of my father, but they are, as you see, joined to another
      shield, which has gules, a silver tower, which are my mother’s. By
      her side I am Spanish, but the family of Morcerf is French, and, I have
      heard, one of the oldest of the south of France.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Monte Cristo “these blazons prove that.
      Almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their
      arms either a cross, in honor of their mission, or birds of passage, in
      sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake, and which they hoped
      to accomplish on the wings of faith. One of your ancestors had joined the
      Crusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you
      mount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is possible,” said Morcerf; “my father has in his
      study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I
      made commentaries that would have greatly edified d’Hozier and
      Jaucourt. At present I no longer think of it, and yet I must tell you that
      we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our
      popular government.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, your government would do well to choose from the past
      something better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments,
      and which have no heraldic meaning whatever. As for you, viscount,”
      continued Monte Cristo to Morcerf, “you are more fortunate than the
      government, for your arms are really beautiful, and speak to the
      imagination. Yes, you are at once from Provence and Spain; that explains,
      if the portrait you showed me be like, the dark hue I so much admired on
      the visage of the noble Catalan.” It would have required the
      penetration of Œdipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count
      concealed beneath these words, apparently uttered with the greatest
      politeness. Morcerf thanked him with a smile, and pushed open the door
      above which were his arms, and which, as we have said, opened into the
      salon. In the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait. It
      was that of a man, from five to eight and thirty, in the uniform of a
      general officer, wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion, that
      indicates superior rank, the ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his
      neck, which showed he was a commander, and on the right breast, the star
      of a grand officer of the order of the Saviour, and on the left that of
      the grand cross of Charles III., which proved that the person represented
      by the picture had served in the wars of Greece and Spain, or, what was
      just the same thing as regarded decorations, had fulfilled some diplomatic
      mission in the two countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than
      he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he found
      himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person. He was a man of forty
      to forty-five years, but he seemed at least fifty, and his black moustache
      and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair, which was
      cut short, in the military fashion. He was dressed in plain clothes, and
      wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he
      belonged. He entered with a tolerably dignified step, and some little
      haste. Monte Cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single
      step. It seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground, and his eyes on
      the Count of Morcerf. “Father,” said the young man, “I
      have the honor of presenting to you the Count of Monte Cristo, the
      generous friend whom I had the good fortune to meet in the critical
      situation of which I have told you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are most welcome, monsieur,” said the Count of Morcerf,
      saluting Monte Cristo with a smile, “and monsieur has rendered our
      house, in preserving its only heir, a service which insures him our
      eternal gratitude.” As he said these words, the count of Morcerf
      pointed to a chair, while he seated himself in another opposite the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo, in taking the seat Morcerf offered him, placed himself in
      such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet
      curtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole
      history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there.
      “The countess,” said Morcerf, “was at her toilet when
      she was informed of the visit she was about to receive. She will, however,
      be in the salon in ten minutes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a great honor to me,” returned Monte Cristo, “to
      be thus, on the first day of my arrival in Paris, brought in contact with
      a man whose merit equals his reputation, and to whom fortune has for once
      been equitable, but has she not still on the plains of Mitidja, or in the
      mountains of Atlas, a marshal’s staff to offer you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” replied Morcerf, reddening slightly, “I have left
      the service, monsieur. Made a peer at the Restoration, I served through
      the first campaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont. I could,
      therefore, expect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened
      had the elder branch remained on the throne? But the Revolution of July
      was, it seems, sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful, and
      it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period. I
      tendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the
      battle-field, you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of
      the salons. I have hung up my sword, and cast myself into politics. I have
      devoted myself to industry; I study the useful arts. During the twenty
      years I served, I often wished to do so, but I had not the time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other,”
      returned Monte Cristo. “A gentleman of high birth, possessor of an
      ample fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure
      soldier, step by step—this is uncommon; then become general, peer of
      France, commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to again commence a
      second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire than
      that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this, indeed, is
      praiseworthy,—nay, more, it is sublime.” Albert looked on and
      listened with astonishment; he was not used to see Monte Cristo give vent
      to such bursts of enthusiasm. “Alas,” continued the stranger,
      doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered Morcerf’s brow,
      “we do not act thus in Italy; we grow according to our race and our
      species, and we pursue the same lines, and often the same uselessness, all
      our lives.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “But, monsieur,” said the Count of Morcerf, “for a man
      of your merit, Italy is not a country, and France opens her arms to
      receive you; respond to her call. France will not, perhaps, be always
      ungrateful. She treats her children ill, but she always welcomes
      strangers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, father,” said Albert with a smile, “it is evident
      you do not know the Count of Monte Cristo; he despises all honors, and
      contents himself with those written on his passport.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is the most just remark,” replied the stranger, “I
      ever heard made concerning myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have been free to choose your career,” observed the Count
      of Morcerf, with a sigh; “and you have chosen the path strewed with
      flowers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo with one of those
      smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I did not fear to fatigue you,” said the general,
      evidently charmed with the count’s manners, “I would have
      taken you to the Chamber; there is a debate very curious to those who are
      strangers to our modern senators.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall be most grateful, monsieur, if you will, at some future
      time, renew your offer, but I have been flattered with the hope of being
      introduced to the countess, and I will therefore wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, here is my mother,” cried the viscount. Monte Cristo,
      turned round hastily, and saw Madame de Morcerf at the entrance of the
      salon, at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered, pale
      and motionless; when Monte Cristo turned round, she let fall her arm,
      which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door-post.
      She had been there some moments, and had heard the last words of the
      visitor. The latter rose and bowed to the countess, who inclined herself
      without speaking. “Ah, good heavens, madame,” said the count,
      “are you ill, or is it the heat of the room that affects you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you ill, mother?” cried the viscount, springing towards
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked them both with a smile. “No,” returned she,
      “but I feel some emotion on seeing, for the first time, the man
      without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation.
      Monsieur,” continued the countess, advancing with the majesty of a
      queen, “I owe to you the life of my son, and for this I bless you.
      Now, I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the
      opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you, from the bottom of my
      heart.” The count bowed again, but lower than before; He was even
      paler than Mercédès. “Madame,” said he, “the count and
      yourself recompense too generously a simple action. To save a man, to
      spare a father’s feelings, or a mother’s sensibility, is not
      to do a good action, but a simple deed of humanity.” At these words,
      uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness, Madame de
      Morcerf replied. “It is very fortunate for my son, monsieur, that he
      found such a friend, and I thank God that things are thus.” And
      Mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of
      gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them. M. de Morcerf
      approached her. “Madame,” said he. “I have already made
      my excuses to the count for quitting him, and I pray you to do so also.
      The sitting commences at two; it is now three, and I am to speak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, then, and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your
      absence,” replied the countess, with the same tone of deep feeling.
      “Monsieur,” continued she, turning to Monte Cristo, “will
      you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Believe me, madame, I feel most grateful for your kindness, but I
      got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning, and I am
      ignorant how I am installed in Paris, which I scarcely know; this is but a
      trifling inquietude, I know, but one that may be appreciated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We shall have the pleasure another time,” said the countess;
      “you promise that?” Monte Cristo inclined himself without
      answering, but the gesture might pass for assent. “I will not detain
      you, monsieur,” continued the countess; “I would not have our
      gratitude become indiscreet or importunate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Count,” said Albert, “I will endeavor to return
      your politeness at Rome, and place my coupé at your disposal until your
      own be ready.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount,” returned the
      Count of Monte Cristo “but I suppose that M. Bertuccio has suitably
      employed the four hours and a half I have given him, and that I shall find
      a carriage of some sort ready at the door.” Albert was used to the
      count’s manner of proceeding; he knew that, like Nero, he was in
      search of the impossible, and nothing astonished him, but wishing to judge
      with his own eyes how far the count’s orders had been executed, he
      accompanied him to the door of the house. Monte Cristo was not deceived.
      As soon as he appeared in the Count of Morcerf’s antechamber, a
      footman, the same who at Rome had brought the count’s card to the
      two young men, and announced his visit, sprang into the vestibule, and
      when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage
      awaiting him. It was a <i>coupé</i> of Koller’s building, and with
      horses and harness for which Drake had, to the knowledge of all the lions
      of Paris, refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas. “Monsieur,”
      said the count to Albert, “I do not ask you to accompany me to my
      house, as I can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry, and I
      have, as you know, a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by
      surprise. Give me, therefore, one more day before I invite you; I shall
      then be certain not to fail in my hospitality.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you ask me for a day, count, I know what to anticipate; it will
      not be a house I shall see, but a palace. You have decidedly some genius
      at your control.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, spread that idea,” replied the Count of Monte
      Cristo, putting his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid
      carriage, “and that will be worth something to me among the ladies.”
      As he spoke, he sprang into the vehicle, the door was closed, but not so
      rapidly that Monte Cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible
      movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left
      Madame de Morcerf. When Albert returned to his mother, he found her in the
      boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair, the whole room so obscure
      that only the shining spangle, fastened here and there to the drapery, and
      the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures, showed with some degree
      of brightness in the gloom. Albert could not see the face of the countess,
      as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head, and which fell
      over her features in misty folds, but it seemed to him as though her voice
      had altered. He could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and
      heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile
      salts, and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle-piece the
      countess’s smelling-bottle, taken from its shagreen case, and
      exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered,—“My dear
      mother, have you been ill during my absence?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and
      orange-flowers throw out at first, before one is used to them, such
      violent perfumes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, my dear mother,” said Albert, putting his hand to the
      bell, “they must be taken into the antechamber. You are really ill,
      and just now were so pale as you came into the room——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was I pale, Albert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not
      the less alarm my father and myself.”

    <p>
      “Did your father speak of it?” inquired Mercédès eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to
      you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I do remember,” replied the countess. A servant entered,
      summoned by Albert’s ring of the bell. “Take these flowers
      into the anteroom or dressing-room,” said the viscount; “they
      make the countess ill.” The footman obeyed his orders. A long pause
      ensued, which lasted until all the flowers were removed. “What is
      this name of Monte Cristo?” inquired the countess, when the servant
      had taken away the last vase of flowers, “is it a family name, or
      the name of the estate, or a simple title?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe, mother, it is merely a title. The count purchased an
      island in the Tuscan archipelago, and, as he told you today, has founded a
      commandery. You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of
      Florence, Saint George, Constantinian of Parma, and even for the Order of
      Malta. Except this, he has no pretension to nobility, and calls himself a
      chance count, although the general opinion at Rome is that the count is a
      man of very high distinction.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His manners are admirable,” said the countess, “at
      least, as far as I could judge in the few minutes he remained here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are perfect mother, so perfect, that they surpass by far all I
      have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of
      Europe—the English, the Spanish, and the German.” The countess
      paused a moment; then, after a slight hesitation, she resumed,—“You
      have seen, my dear Albert—I ask the question as a mother—you
      have seen M. de Monte Cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much
      knowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you think
      the count is really what he appears to be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What does he appear to be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you have just said,—a man of high distinction.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what is your own opinion, Albert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion
      respecting him, but I think him a Maltese.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not ask you of his origin but what he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, what he is; that is quite another thing. I have seen so many
      remarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what I
      think, I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byron’s
      heroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some Manfred, some
      Lara, some Werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient
      family, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the
      force of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws of
      society.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You say——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the
      Mediterranean, without inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers of
      all nations, and pirates of every flag. Who knows whether or not these
      industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his
      protection?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is possible,” said the countess, reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind,” continued the young man, “smuggler or not,
      you must agree, mother dear, as you have seen him, that the Count of Monte
      Cristo is a remarkable man, who will have the greatest success in the
      salons of Paris. Why, this very morning, in my rooms, he made his <i>entrée</i>
      amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement, not even excepting
      Château-Renaud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what do you suppose is the count’s age?” inquired
      Mercédès, evidently attaching great importance to this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So young,—it is impossible,” said Mercédès, replying at
      the same time to what Albert said as well as to her own private
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me,
      and certainly without the slightest premeditation, ‘at such a period
      I was five years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,’
      and I, induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have
      compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. The age of this
      singular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.
      Besides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair, and
      his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,—he is not only
      vigorous, but also young.” The countess bent her head, as if beneath
      a heavy wave of bitter thoughts. “And has this man displayed a
      friendship for you, Albert?” she asked with a nervous shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am inclined to think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And—do—you—like—him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, he pleases me in spite of Franz d’Epinay, who tries to
      convince me that he is a being returned from the other world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Albert,” she said, in a voice which was altered by emotion,
      “I have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances. Now
      you are a man, and are able to give me advice; yet I repeat to you,
      Albert, be prudent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, my dear mother, it is necessary, in order to make your advice
      turn to account, that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust.
      The count never plays, he only drinks pure water tinged with a little
      sherry, and is so rich that he cannot, without intending to laugh at me,
      try to borrow money. What, then, have I to fear from him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right,” said the countess, “and my fears are
      weakness, especially when directed against a man who has saved your life.
      How did your father receive him, Albert? It is necessary that we should be
      more than complaisant to the count. M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied,
      his business makes him reflective, and he might, without intending it——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing could be in better taste than my father’s demeanor,
      madame,” said Albert; “nay, more, he seemed greatly flattered
      at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably
      paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years. Each
      of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father,” added
      Albert with a laugh. “And thus they parted the best possible
      friends, and M. de Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear
      the speakers.” The countess made no reply. She fell into so deep a
      reverie that her eyes gradually closed. The young man, standing up before
      her, gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and
      endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome. Then,
      after seeing her eyes closed, and hearing her breathe gently, he believed
      she had dropped asleep, and left the apartment on tiptoe, closing the door
      after him with the utmost precaution. “This devil of a fellow,”
      he muttered, shaking his head; “I said at the time he would create a
      sensation here, and I measure his effect by an infallible thermometer. My
      mother has noticed him, and he must therefore, perforce, be remarkable.”
      He went down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when he
      remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a “turnout”
      which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs.
      “Most decidedly,” said he, “men are not equal, and I
      must beg my father to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers.”

      Chapter 42. Monsieur Bertuccio
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>eanwhile the count
      had arrived at his house; it had taken him six minutes to perform the
      distance, but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men
      who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase
      themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich
      foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs apiece for his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house Ali had chosen, and which was to serve as a town residence to
      Monte Cristo, was situated on the right hand as you ascend the
      Champs-Élysées. A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre, and
      masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys, like two
      arms, extended right and left, and formed a carriage-drive from the iron
      gates to a double portico, on every step of which stood a porcelain vase,
      filled with flowers. This house, isolated from the rest, had, besides the
      main entrance, another in the Rue Ponthieu. Even before the coachman had
      hailed the <i>concierge</i>, the massy gates rolled on their hinges—they
      had seen the Count coming, and at Paris, as everywhere else, he was served
      with the rapidity of lightning. The coachman entered and traversed the
      half-circle without slackening his speed, and the gates were closed ere
      the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel. The carriage stopped at the
      left side of the portico, two men presented themselves at the
      carriage-window; the one was Ali, who, smiling with an expression of the
      most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid by a mere look from Monte Cristo.
      The other bowed respectfully, and offered his arm to assist the count in
      descending. “Thanks, M. Bertuccio,” said the count, springing
      lightly up the three steps of the portico; “and the notary?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is in the small salon, excellency,” returned Bertuccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the
      number of the house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best
      engraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The first
      card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron
      Danglars, Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, No. 7; the others are on the
      mantle-piece of your excellency’s bedroom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good; what o’clock is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Four o’clock.” Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and
      gloves to the same French footman who had called his carriage at the Count
      of Morcerf’s, and then he passed into the small salon, preceded by
      Bertuccio, who showed him the way. “These are but indifferent
      marbles in this antechamber,” said Monte Cristo. “I trust all
      this will soon be taken away.” Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had
      said, the notary awaited him in the small salon. He was a simple-looking
      lawyer’s clerk, elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a
      provincial scrivener. “You are the notary empowered to sell the
      country house that I wish to purchase, monsieur?” asked Monte
      Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, count,” returned the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is the deed of sale ready?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you brought it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well; and where is this house that I purchase?” asked
      the count carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the
      notary. The steward made a gesture that signified, “I do not know.”
      The notary looked at the count with astonishment. “What!” said
      he, “does not the count know where the house he purchases is
      situated?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” returned the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count does not know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have
      never before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even set
      my foot in France.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.”
      At these words Bertuccio turned pale. “And where is Auteuil?”
      asked the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Close by here, monsieur,” replied the notary—“a
      little beyond Passy; a charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de
      Boulogne.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So near as that?” said the Count; “but that is not in
      the country. What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M.
      Bertuccio?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I,” cried the steward with a strange expression. “His
      excellency did not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency
      will recollect—if he will think——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true,” observed Monte Cristo; “I recollect now. I
      read the advertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false
      title, ‘a country house.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not yet too late,” cried Bertuccio, eagerly; “and
      if your excellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a
      better at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” returned Monte Cristo negligently; “since I
      have this, I will keep it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you are quite right,” said the notary, who feared to lose
      his fee. “It is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water
      and fine trees; a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long
      time, without reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet
      valuable, now that old things are so much sought after. I suppose the
      count has the tastes of the day?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be sure,” returned Monte Cristo; “it is very
      convenient, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is more—it is magnificent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Peste!</i> let us not lose such an opportunity,” returned
      Monte Cristo. “The deed, if you please, Mr. Notary.” And he
      signed it rapidly, after having first run his eye over that part of the
      deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of
      the proprietors. “Bertuccio,” said he, “give fifty-five
      thousand francs to monsieur.” The steward left the room with a
      faltering step, and returned with a bundle of bank-notes, which the notary
      counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is
      sure it is all there. “And now,” demanded the count, “are
      all the forms complied with?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you the keys?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the
      house, but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his
      new possessions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well;” and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the
      notary, which said, “I have no further need of you; you may go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” observed the honest notary, “the count is, I
      think, mistaken; it is only fifty thousand francs, everything included.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And your fee?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is included in this sum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But have you not come from Auteuil here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of
      time and trouble,” said the count; and he made a gesture of polite
      dismissal. The notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the
      ground; it was the first time he had ever met a similar client. “See
      this gentleman out,” said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward
      followed the notary out of the room. Scarcely was the count alone, when he
      drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock, and opened it with a key
      which he wore round his neck, and which never left him. After having
      sought for a few minutes, he stopped at a leaf which had several notes,
      and compared them with the deed of sale, which lay on the table, and
      recalling his <i>souvenirs</i>—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;’ it is indeed the
      same,” said he; “and now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted
      by religious or physical terror? However, in an hour I shall know all.
      Bertuccio!” cried he, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle
      on a small gong. “Bertuccio!” The steward appeared at the
      door. “Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count, “did you
      never tell me that you had travelled in France?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In some parts of France—yes, excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know the environs of Paris, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, excellency, no,” returned the steward, with a sort of
      nervous trembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions,
      rightly attributed to great disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is unfortunate,” returned he, “that you have never
      visited the environs, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and
      had you gone with me, you could have given me some useful information.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Auteuil!” cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became
      livid—“I go to Auteuil?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what is there surprising in that? When I live at Auteuil, you
      must come there, as you belong to my service.” Bertuccio hung down
      his head before the imperious look of his master, and remained motionless,
      without making any answer. “Why, what has happened to you?—are
      you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage?” asked
      Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis XIV. pronounced the famous,
      “I have been almost obliged to wait.” Bertuccio made but one
      bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse voice—“His
      excellency’s horses!” Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes,
      and, as he sealed the last, the steward appeared. “Your excellency’s
      carriage is at the door,” said he.

      “Well, take your hat and gloves,” returned Monte Cristo.

      “Am I to accompany you, your excellency?” cried Bertuccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the
      house.” It was unexampled for a servant of the count’s to dare
      to dispute an order of his, so the steward, without saying a word,
      followed his master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to
      follow, which he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.

      Chapter 43. The House at Auteuil
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>onte Cristo
      noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio signed himself in
      the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of the cross in the air
      with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the carriage, muttered a short
      prayer. Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have
      had pity on seeing the steward’s extraordinary repugnance for the
      count’s projected drive without the walls; but the Count was too
      curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey. In twenty minutes
      they were at Auteuil; the steward’s emotion had continued to augment
      as they entered the village. Bertuccio, crouched in the corner of the
      carriage, began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they
      passed. “Tell them to stop at Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28,”
      said the count, fixing his eyes on the steward, to whom he gave this
      order. Bertuccio’s forehead was covered with perspiration; however,
      he obeyed, and, leaning out of the window, he cried to the coachman,—“Rue
      de la Fontaine, No. 28.” No. 28 was situated at the extremity of the
      village; during the drive night had set in, and darkness gave the
      surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage. The
      carriage stopped, the footman sprang off the box, and opened the door.
      “Well,” said the count, “you do not get out, M.
      Bertuccio—you are going to stay in the carriage, then? What are you
      thinking of this evening?” Bertuccio sprang out, and offered his
      shoulder to the count, who, this time, leaned upon it as he descended the
      three steps of the carriage. “Knock,” said the count, “and
      announce me.” Bertuccio knocked, the door opened, and the concierge
      appeared. “What is it?” asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is your new master, my good fellow,” said the footman. And
      he held out to the concierge the notary’s order.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The house is sold, then?” demanded the concierge; “and
      this gentleman is coming to live here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my friend,” returned the count; “and I will
      endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, monsieur,” said the concierge, “I shall not have
      much cause to regret him, for he came here but seldom; it is five years
      since he was here last, and he did well to sell the house, for it did not
      bring him in anything at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was the name of your old master?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Marquis of Saint-Méran. Ah, I am sure he has not sold the house
      for what he gave for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Marquis of Saint-Méran!” returned the count. “The
      name is not unknown to me; the Marquis of Saint-Méran!” and he
      appeared to meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An old gentleman,” continued the concierge, “a staunch
      follower of the Bourbons; he had an only daughter, who married M. de
      Villefort, who had been the king’s attorney at Nîmes, and afterwards
      at Versailles.” Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio, who became whiter
      than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling.
      “And is not this daughter dead?” demanded Monte Cristo;
      “I fancy I have heard so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, monsieur, one and twenty years ago; and since then we have not
      seen the poor marquis three times.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, thanks,” said Monte Cristo, judging from the steward’s
      utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without
      danger of breaking it. “Give me a light.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I accompany you, monsieur?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, it is unnecessary; Bertuccio will show me a light.” And
      Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces, which
      produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge. “Ah,
      monsieur,” said he, after having vainly searched on the mantle-piece
      and the shelves, “I have not got any candles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take one of the carriage-lamps, Bertuccio,” said the count,
      “and show me the apartments.” The steward obeyed in silence,
      but it was easy to see, from the manner in which the hand that held the
      light trembled, how much it cost him to obey. They went over a tolerably
      large ground floor; a first floor consisted of a salon, a bathroom, and
      two bedrooms; near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase
      that led down to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, here is a private staircase,” said the count; “that
      is convenient. Light me, M. Bertuccio, and go first; we will see where it
      leads to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” replied Bertuccio, “it leads to the garden.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And, pray, how do you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It ought to do so, at least.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, let us be sure of that.” Bertuccio sighed, and went on
      first; the stairs did, indeed, lead to the garden. At the outer door the
      steward paused. “Go on, Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count.
      But he who was addressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned; his
      haggard eyes glanced around, as if in search of the traces of some
      terrible event, and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out
      horrible recollections. “Well,” insisted the Count. “No,
      no,” cried Bertuccio, setting down the lantern at the angle of the
      interior wall. “No, monsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What does this mean?” demanded the irresistible voice of
      Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you must see, your excellency,” cried the steward,
      “that this is not natural; that, having a house to purchase, you
      purchase it exactly at Auteuil, and that, purchasing it at Auteuil, this
      house should be No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine. Oh, why did I not tell you
      all? I am sure you would not have forced me to come. I hoped your house
      would have been some other one than this; as if there was not another
      house at Auteuil than that of the assassination!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, what!” cried Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, “what
      words do you utter? Devil of a man, Corsican that you are—always
      mysteries or superstitions. Come, take the lantern, and let us visit the
      garden; you are not afraid of ghosts with me, I hope?” Bertuccio
      raised the lantern, and obeyed. The door, as it opened, disclosed a gloomy
      sky, in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds
      that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant,
      only to sink into obscurity. The steward wished to turn to the left.
      “No, no, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo. “What is the use
      of following the alleys? Here is a beautiful lawn; let us go on straight
      forwards.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow, but obeyed; however, he
      continued to take the left hand. Monte Cristo, on the contrary, took the
      right hand; arrived near a clump of trees, he stopped. The steward could
      not restrain himself. “Move, monsieur—move away, I entreat
      you; you are exactly in the spot!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What spot?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where he fell.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “My dear Monsieur Bertuccio,” said Monte Cristo, laughing,
      “control yourself; we are not at Sartène or at Corte. This is not a
      Corsican <i>maquis</i> but an English garden; badly kept, I own, but still
      you must not calumniate it for that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur, I implore you do not stay there!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think you are going mad, Bertuccio,” said the count coldly.
      “If that is the case, I warn you, I shall have you put in a lunatic
      asylum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, excellency,” returned Bertuccio, joining his hands, and
      shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count’s
      laughter, had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him, and
      rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous
      conscience. “Alas, excellency, the evil has arrived!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Bertuccio,” said the count, “I am very glad to tell
      you, that while you gesticulate, you wring your hands and roll your eyes
      like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him; and I have always
      observed, that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret. I knew
      you were a Corsican. I knew you were gloomy, and always brooding over some
      old history of the vendetta; and I overlooked that in Italy, because in
      Italy those things are thought nothing of. But in France they are
      considered in very bad taste; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves
      with such affairs, judges who condemn, and scaffolds which avenge.”
      Bertuccio clasped his hands, and as, in all these evolutions, he did not
      let fall the lantern, the light showed his pale and altered countenance.
      Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that, at Rome, he had bent
      upon the execution of Andrea, and then, in a tone that made a shudder pass
      through the veins of the poor steward,—“The Abbé Busoni, then
      told me an untruth,” said he, “when, after his journey in
      France, in 1829, he sent you to me, with a letter of recommendation, in
      which he enumerated all your valuable qualities. Well, I shall write to
      the abbé; I shall hold him responsible for his <i>protégé’s</i>
      misconduct, and I shall soon know all about this assassination. Only I
      warn you, that when I reside in a country, I conform to all its code, and
      I have no wish to put myself within the compass of the French laws for
      your sake.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, do not do that, excellency; I have always served you
      faithfully,” cried Bertuccio, in despair. “I have always been
      an honest man, and, as far as lay in my power, I have done good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not deny it,” returned the count; “but why are you
      thus agitated. It is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such
      paleness in the cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, your excellency,” replied Bertuccio hesitatingly,
      “did not the Abbé Busoni, who heard my confession in the prison at
      Nîmes, tell you that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I
      concluded you had stolen—that was all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, your excellency,” returned Bertuccio in deep contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or, as you are a Corsican, that you had been unable to resist the
      desire of making a ‘stiff,’ as you call it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my good master,” cried Bertuccio, casting himself at the
      count’s feet, “it was simply vengeance—nothing else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I understand that, but I do not understand what it is that
      galvanizes you in this manner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, monsieur, it is very natural,” returned Bertuccio,
      “since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What! my house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whose, then? The Marquis de Saint-Méran, I think, the concierge
      said. What had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-Méran?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is strange,” returned Monte Cristo, seeming to yield to
      his reflections, “that you should find yourself without any
      preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much
      remorse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” said the steward, “it is fatality, I am
      sure. First, you purchase a house at Auteuil—this house is the one
      where I have committed an assassination; you descend to the garden by the
      same staircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he
      received the blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just
      buried his child. This is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too
      much like providence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, amiable Corsican, let us suppose it is providence. I always
      suppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede something
      to diseased minds. Come, collect yourself, and tell me all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have related it but once, and that was to the Abbé Busoni. Such
      things,” continued Bertuccio, shaking his head, “are only
      related under the seal of confession.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said the count, “I refer you to your confessor.
      Turn Chartreux or Trappist, and relate your secrets, but, as for me, I do
      not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms, and I do not choose that
      my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening. I
      confess I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police,
      for, in Italy, justice is only paid when silent—in France she is
      paid only when she speaks. <i>Peste!</i> I thought you somewhat Corsican,
      a great deal smuggler, and an excellent steward; but I see you have other
      strings to your bow. You are no longer in my service, Monsieur Bertuccio.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, your excellency, your excellency!” cried the steward,
      struck with terror at this threat, “if that is the only reason I
      cannot remain in your service, I will tell all, for if I quit you, it will
      only be to go to the scaffold.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is different,” replied Monte Cristo; “but if you
      intend to tell an untruth, reflect it were better not to speak at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, monsieur, I swear to you, by my hopes of salvation, I will tell
      you all, for the Abbé Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret; but, I
      pray you, go away from that plane-tree. The moon is just bursting through
      the clouds, and there, standing where you do, and wrapped in that cloak
      that conceals your figure, you remind me of M. de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What!” cried Monte Cristo, “it was M. de Villefort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency knows him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The former royal attorney at Nîmes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who married the Marquis of Saint-Méran’s daughter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe, the most
      upright, the most rigid magistrate on the bench?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, monsieur,” said Bertuccio, “this man with this
      spotless reputation——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was a villain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah,” replied Monte Cristo, “impossible!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is as I tell you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, really,” said Monte Cristo. “Have you proof of
      this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you have lost it; how stupid!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but by careful search it might be recovered.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really,” returned the count, “relate it to me, for it
      begins to interest me.” And the count, humming an air from <i>Lucia</i>,
      went to sit down on a bench, while Bertuccio followed him, collecting his
      thoughts. Bertuccio remained standing before him.

      Chapter 44. The Vendetta
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t what point shall
      I begin my story, your excellency?” asked Bertuccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where you please,” returned Monte Cristo, “since I know
      nothing at all of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought the Abbé Busoni had told your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Some particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago,
      and I have forgotten them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, M. Bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening
      papers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The story begins in 1815.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Monte Cristo, “1815 is not yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they
      had happened but then. I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the
      service of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed
      entirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we became orphans—I
      at five, he at eighteen. He brought me up as if I had been his son, and in
      1814 he married. When the emperor returned from the Island of Elba, my
      brother instantly joined the army, was slightly wounded at Waterloo, and
      retired with the army beyond the Loire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But that is the history of the Hundred Days, M. Bertuccio,”
      said the count; “unless I am mistaken, it has been already written.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you
      promised to be patient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on; I will keep my word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One day we received a letter. I should tell you that we lived in
      the little village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cap Corse. This letter
      was from my brother. He told us that the army was disbanded, and that he
      should return by Châteauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and Nîmes; and, if
      I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at Nîmes, with an
      innkeeper with whom I had dealings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the smuggling line?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eh, your excellency? Everyone must live.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I
      resolved not to send the money, but to take it to him myself. I possessed
      a thousand francs. I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law, and
      with the other five hundred I set off for Nîmes. It was easy to do so, and
      as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything favored my
      project. But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind became contrary,
      so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhône.
      At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to Arles. I left the boat
      between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and took the road to Nîmes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are getting to the story now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency; excuse me, but, as you will see, I only tell
      you what is absolutely necessary. Just at this time the famous massacres
      took place in the south of France. Three brigands, called Trestaillon,
      Truphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected
      of Bonapartism. You have doubtless heard of these massacres, your
      excellency?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Vaguely; I was far from France at that period. Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I entered Nîmes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you
      encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered, and
      burned. At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became terrified,
      not for myself—for I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had nothing to
      fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us smugglers—but
      for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from the army of the
      Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was everything to
      apprehend. I hastened to the innkeeper. My misgivings had been but too
      true. My brother had arrived the previous evening at Nîmes, and, at the
      very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality, he had
      been assassinated. I did all in my power to discover the murderers, but no
      one durst tell me their names, so much were they dreaded. I then thought
      of that French justice of which I had heard so much, and which feared
      nothing, and I went to the king’s attorney.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And this king’s attorney was named Villefort?” asked
      Monte Cristo carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been
      deputy-procureur. His zeal had procured him advancement, and he was said
      to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure
      from the Island of Elba.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Monte Cristo “you went to him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Monsieur,’ I said, ‘my brother was assassinated
      yesterday in the streets of Nîmes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty
      to find out. You are the representative of justice here, and it is for
      justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect.’—‘Who
      was your brother?’ asked he.—‘A lieutenant in the
      Corsican battalion.’—‘A soldier of the usurper, then?’—‘A
      soldier of the French army.’—‘Well,’ replied he,
      ‘he has smitten with the sword, and he has perished by the sword.’—‘You
      are mistaken, monsieur,’ I replied; ‘he has perished by the
      poniard.’—‘What do you want me to do?’ asked the
      magistrate.—‘I have already told you—avenge him.’—‘On
      whom?’—‘On his murderers.’—‘How should
      I know who they are?’—‘Order them to be sought for.’—‘Why,
      your brother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a duel. All
      these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the
      emperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people here do not like
      soldiers of such disorderly conduct.’—‘Monsieur,’
      I replied, ‘it is not for myself that I entreat your interference—I
      should grieve for him or avenge him, but my poor brother had a wife, and
      were anything to happen to me, the poor creature would perish from want,
      for my brother’s pay alone kept her. Pray, try and obtain a small
      government pension for her.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Every revolution has its catastrophes,’ returned M. de
      Villefort; ‘your brother has been the victim of this. It is a
      misfortune, and government owes nothing to his family. If we are to judge
      by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the
      partisans of the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your
      brother would be today, in all probability, condemned to death. What has
      happened is quite natural, and in conformity with the law of reprisals.’—‘What,’
      cried I, ‘do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?’—‘All
      these Corsicans are mad, on my honor,’ replied M. de Villefort;
      ‘they fancy that their countryman is still emperor. You have
      mistaken the time, you should have told me this two months ago, it is too
      late now. Go now, at once, or I shall have you put out.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope
      from further entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and
      said in a low voice, ‘Well, since you know the Corsicans so well,
      you know that they always keep their word. You think that it was a good
      deed to kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a
      royalist. Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you,
      which is, that I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta
      against you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we
      meet your last hour has come.’ And before he had recovered from his
      surprise, I opened the door and left the room.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well,” said Monte Cristo, “such an innocent
      looking person as you are to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a king’s
      attorney at that! But did he know what was meant by the terrible word
      ‘vendetta’?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his
      house, and never went out unattended, seeking me high and low.
      Fortunately, I was so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he
      became alarmed, and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes, so he solicited a
      change of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was
      nominated to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to
      avenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it went,
      was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him on
      foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him only—for I had
      an opportunity of doing so a hundred times—but to kill him without
      being discovered—at least, without being arrested. I no longer
      belonged to myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for.
      For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took not a
      step out-of-doors without my following him. At length I discovered that he
      went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him thither, and I saw him enter
      the house where we now are, only, instead of entering by the great door
      that looks into the street, he came on horseback, or in his carriage, left
      the one or the other at the little inn, and entered by the gate you see
      there.” Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could
      discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded. “As I
      had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and gained all
      the information I could. If I wished to surprise him, it was evident this
      was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged, as the concierge
      informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran, Villefort’s
      father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so that this country
      house was useless to him, and it was reported to be let to a young widow,
      known only by the name of ‘the baroness.’

      “One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and
      handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not
      overlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de
      Villefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her
      features, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As
      she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure, I saw
      she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the little door
      was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to meet him. They
      threw themselves into each other’s arms, embraced tenderly, and
      returned together to the house. The man was M. de Villefort; I fully
      believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse
      the whole of the garden alone.”

    <p>
      “And,” asked the count, “did you ever know the name of
      this woman?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, excellency,” returned Bertuccio; “you will see that
      I had no time to learn it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That evening,” continued Bertuccio, “I could have
      killed the procureur, but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the
      neighborhood, I was fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if
      his cries were overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the next
      occasion, and in order that nothing should escape me, I took a chamber
      looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden. Three days
      after, about seven o’clock in the evening, I saw a servant on
      horseback leave the house at full gallop, and take the road to Sèvres. I
      concluded that he was going to Versailles, and I was not deceived. Three
      hours later, the man returned covered with dust, his errand was performed,
      and two minutes after, another man on foot, muffled in a mantle, opened
      the little door of the garden, which he closed after him. I descended
      rapidly; although I had not seen Villefort’s face, I recognized him
      by the beating of my heart. I crossed the street, and stopped at a post
      placed at the angle of the wall, and by means of which I had once before
      looked into the garden. This time I did not content myself with looking,
      but I took my knife out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and
      sprang over the wall. My first care was to run to the door; he had left
      the key in it, taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the
      lock. Nothing, then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined the
      grounds. The garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf extended
      down the middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and
      massy foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and flowers. In order
      to go from the door to the house, or from the house to the door, M. de
      Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees.

      “It was the end of September; the wind blew violently. The faint
      glimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds
      that were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led to
      the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick
      shrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of
      discovery. I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must
      take, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I fancied I
      heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your excellency,
      that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low
      cries perpetually ringing in his ears. Two hours passed thus, during which
      I imagined I heard moans repeatedly. Midnight struck. As the last stroke
      died away, I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private
      staircase by which we have just descended. The door opened, and the man in
      the mantle reappeared. The terrible moment had come, but I had so long
      been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least. I drew my
      knife from my pocket again, opened it, and made ready to strike. The man
      in the mantle advanced towards me, but as he drew near I saw that he had a
      weapon in his hand. I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of a failure.
      When he was only a few paces from me, I saw that what I had taken for a
      weapon was only a spade. I was still unable to divine for what reason M.
      de Villefort had this spade in his hands, when he stopped close to the
      thicket where I was, glanced round, and began to dig a hole in the earth.
      I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle, which he
      laid on the grass in order to dig more freely. Then, I confess, curiosity
      mingled with hatred; I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there,
      and I remained motionless, holding my breath. Then an idea crossed my
      mind, which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his
      mantle a box, two feet long, and six or eight inches deep. I let him place
      the box in the hole he had made, then, while he stamped with his feet to
      remove all traces of his occupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife
      into his breast, exclaiming,—‘I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy
      death for my brother’s; thy treasure for his widow; thou seest that
      my vengeance is more complete than I had hoped.’ I know not if he
      heard these words; I think he did not, for he fell without a cry. I felt
      his blood gush over my face, but I was intoxicated, I was delirious, and
      the blood refreshed, instead of burning me. In a second I had disinterred
      the box; then, that it might not be known I had done so, I filled up the
      hole, threw the spade over the wall, and rushed through the door, which I
      double-locked, carrying off the key.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Monte Cristo “it seems to me this was nothing
      but murder and robbery.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, your excellency,” returned Bertuccio; “it was a
      vendetta followed by restitution.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And was the sum a large one?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was not money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I recollect,” replied the count; “did you not say
      something of an infant?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and
      with my knife forced open the lock of the box. In a fine linen cloth was
      wrapped a new-born child. Its purple visage, and its violet-colored hands
      showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not yet cold,
      I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet. After a moment
      I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart, and as I had been
      assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a doctor would have done—I
      inflated the lungs by blowing air into them, and at the expiration of a
      quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and cried feebly. In my turn I
      uttered a cry, but a cry of joy. ‘God has not cursed me then,’
      I cried, ‘since he permits me to save the life of a human creature,
      in exchange for the life I have taken away.’”

    <p>
      “And what did you do with the child?” asked Monte Cristo.
      “It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at
      Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures. As I passed
      the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road, and I
      inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement, the linen
      proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents, the blood with which I
      was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone
      else. No objection was raised, but they pointed out the asylum, which was
      situated at the upper end of the Rue d’Enfer, and after having taken
      the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces, so that one of the two
      letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child, while
      the other remained in my possession, I rang the bell, and fled with all
      speed. A fortnight after I was at Rogliano, and I said to Assunta,—‘Console
      thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.’ She demanded
      what I meant, and when I had told her all,—‘Giovanni,’
      said she, ‘you should have brought this child with you; we would
      have replaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then,
      in consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.’ In
      reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him
      if we became rich.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What letters were marked on the linen?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An H and an N, surmounted by a baron’s coronet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By heaven, M. Bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did
      you study heraldry?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In your service, excellency, where everything is learned.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, I am curious to know two things.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are they, your excellency?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What became of this little boy? for I think you told me it was a
      boy, M. Bertuccio.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No excellency, I do not recollect telling you that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought you did; I must have been mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. But your
      excellency wished to know two things; what was the second?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked
      for a confessor, and the Abbé Busoni came to visit you at your request in
      the prison at Nîmes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The story will be very long, excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What matter? you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose
      you are very much inclined for it either.” Bertuccio bowed, and
      resumed his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me,
      partly to supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my
      trade of smuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the
      laws which always follows a revolution. The southern districts were
      ill-watched in particular, in consequence of the disturbances that were
      perpetually breaking out in Avignon, Nîmes, or Uzès. We profited by this
      respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere. Since my
      brother’s assassination in the streets of Nîmes, I had never entered
      the town; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected,
      seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to come to us, and
      had established a branch to his inn, on the road from Bellegarde to
      Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. We had thus, at Aigues-Mortes,
      Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our goods, and where, in
      case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and
      custom-house officers. Smuggling is a profitable trade, when a certain
      degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for myself, brought up in
      the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and
      custom-house officers, as my appearance before the judges would cause an
      inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into the past. And in my past
      life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled
      cigars, or barrels of brandy without a permit. So, preferring death to
      capture, I accomplished the most astonishing deeds, and which, more than
      once, showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only
      obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision,
      and vigorous and determined execution. In reality, when you have once
      devoted your life to your enterprises, you are no longer the equal of
      other men, or, rather, other men are no longer your equals, and whosoever
      has taken this resolution, feels his strength and resources doubled.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Philosophy, M. Bertuccio,” interrupted the Count; “you
      have done a little of everything in your life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, excellency!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late;
      yet I have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct,
      which is more than can be said for all philosophy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive.
      Assunta took care of all, and our little fortune increased. One day as I
      was setting off on an expedition, ‘Go,’ said she; ‘at
      your return I will give you a surprise.’ I questioned her, but in
      vain; she would tell me nothing, and I departed. Our expedition lasted
      nearly six weeks; we had been to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for
      English cottons, and we ran our cargo without opposition, and returned
      home full of joy. When I entered the house, the first thing I beheld in
      the middle of Assunta’s chamber was a cradle that might be called
      sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture, and in it a baby seven
      or eight months old. I uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I
      had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the
      recollection that I had abandoned this child. For the assassination itself
      I had never felt any remorse. Poor Assunta had guessed all. She had
      profited by my absence, and furnished with the half of the linen, and
      having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at
      the asylum, had set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it. No objection was
      raised, and the infant was given up to her. Ah, I confess, your
      excellency, when I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its
      cradle, I felt my eyes filled with tears. ‘Ah, Assunta,’ cried
      I, ‘you are an excellent woman, and heaven will bless you.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This,” said Monte Cristo, “is less correct than your
      philosophy,—it is only faith.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, your excellency is right,” replied Bertuccio, “and
      God made this infant the instrument of our punishment. Never did a
      perverse nature declare itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing
      to any fault in his bringing up. He was a most lovely child, with large
      blue eyes, of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond
      complexion; only his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most
      singular expression, and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice
      of his smile. Unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that ‘red
      is either altogether good or altogether bad.’ The proverb was but
      too correct as regarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested
      the worst disposition. It is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother
      encouraged him. This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the town,
      five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and the most
      tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese preserves, the
      chestnuts stolen from a neighbor’s orchard, or the dried apples in
      his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my
      garden. One day, when Benedetto was about five or six, our neighbor
      Wasilio, who, according to the custom of the country, never locked up his
      purse or his valuables—for, as your excellency knows, there are no
      thieves in Corsica—complained that he had lost a louis out of his
      purse; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money, but
      he persisted in the accuracy of his statement. One day, Benedetto, who had
      been gone from the house since morning, to our great anxiety, did not
      return until late in the evening, dragging a monkey after him, which he
      said he had found chained to the foot of a tree. For more than a month
      past, the mischievous child, who knew not what to wish for, had taken it
      into his head to have a monkey. A boatman, who had passed by Rogliano, and
      who had several of these animals, whose tricks had greatly diverted him,
      had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him. ‘Monkeys are not found
      in our woods chained to trees,’ said I; ‘confess how you
      obtained this animal.’ Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had
      said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his
      imagination than to his veracity. I became angry; he began to laugh, I
      threatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards. ‘You
      cannot beat me,’ said he; ‘you have no right, for you are not
      my father.’

      “We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so
      carefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the
      child’s whole character revealed itself, that almost terrified me,
      and my arm fell without touching him. The boy triumphed, and this victory
      rendered him so audacious, that all the money of Assunta, whose affection
      for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it, was spent in
      caprices she knew not how to contend against, and follies she had not the
      courage to prevent. When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly,
      but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master, and
      everything went ill. When he was only eleven, he chose his companions from
      among the young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst characters in Bastia,
      or, indeed, in Corsica, and they had already, for some mischievous pranks,
      been several times threatened with a prosecution. I became alarmed, as any
      prosecution might be attended with serious consequences. I was compelled,
      at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition; I reflected
      for a long time, and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune,
      I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me. I hoped that the active and
      laborious life of a smuggler, with the severe discipline on board, would
      have a salutary effect on his character, which was now well-nigh, if not
      quite, corrupt. I spoke to Benedetto alone, and proposed to him to
      accompany me, endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to
      dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve. He heard me patiently, and
      when I had finished, burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Are you mad, uncle?’ (he called me by this name when
      he was in good humor); ‘do you think I am going to change the life I
      lead for your mode of existence—my agreeable indolence for the hard
      and precarious toil you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at
      night, and the scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and
      when you are perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry
      sum? Why, I have as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes
      me when I ask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your
      offer.’ The arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me.
      Benedetto rejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me
      out to them as a fool.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sweet child,” murmured Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, had he been my own son,” replied Bertuccio, “or
      even my nephew, I would have brought him back to the right road, for the
      knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea
      that I was striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible
      for me to punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the
      unfortunate boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several
      times missed money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in
      which to conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was already
      made up. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the
      fit seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week. My
      intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and without letting
      him know anything of my plan, to convey him some morning on board; by this
      means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct. I set off
      for France, after having fixed upon the plan. Our cargo was to be landed
      in the Gulf of Lyons, and this was a difficult thing to do because it was
      then the year 1829. The most perfect tranquillity was restored, and the
      vigilance of the custom-house officers was redoubled, and their strictness
      was increased at this time, in consequence of the fair at Beaucaire.

      “Our expedition made a favorable beginning. We anchored our vessel—which
      had a double hold, where our goods were concealed—amidst a number of
      other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhône from Beaucaire to
      Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night, and to
      convey it into the town, by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were
      connected. Whether success rendered us imprudent, or whether we were
      betrayed, I know not; but one evening, about five o’clock, our
      little cabin-boy came breathlessly, to inform us that he had seen a
      detachment of custom-house officers advancing in our direction. It was not
      their proximity that alarmed us, for detachments were constantly
      patrolling along the banks of the Rhône, but the care, according to the
      boy’s account, that they took to avoid being seen. In an instant we
      were on the alert, but it was too late; our vessel was surrounded, and
      amongst the custom-house officers I observed several gendarmes, and, as
      terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of
      any other, I sprang into the hold, opened a port, and dropped into the
      river, dived, and only rose at intervals to breathe, until I reached a
      ditch that had recently been made from the Rhône to the canal that runs
      from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. I was now safe, for I could swim along
      the ditch without being seen, and I reached the canal in safety. I had
      designedly taken this direction. I have already told your excellency of an
      innkeeper from Nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from
      Bellegarde to Beaucaire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Monte Cristo “I perfectly recollect him; I
      think he was your colleague.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely,” answered Bertuccio; “but he had, seven or
      eight years before this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at
      Marseilles, who, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to
      make his fortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with
      the new landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I
      intended to ask shelter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was his name?” inquired the count, who seemed to become
      somewhat interested in Bertuccio’s story.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of
      Carconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her
      village. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by
      inches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or five
      and forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample proof of
      his presence of mind and courage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you say,” interrupted Monte Cristo “that this took
      place towards the year——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “1829, your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what month?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “June.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The beginning or the end?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The evening of the 3d.”

    <p>
      “Ah,” said Monte Cristo “the evening of the 3d of June,
      1829. Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as
      we never entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not to
      break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept amongst
      the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might have some
      guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night, and
      which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in which holes had
      been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our
      presence. My intention was, if Caderousse was alone, to acquaint him with
      my presence, finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted,
      and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhône, and ascertain
      the state of our vessel and its crew. I stepped into the shed, and it was
      fortunate I did so, for at that moment Caderousse entered with a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I
      could do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before.
      The man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of
      France; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the
      Beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair lasts, and during which
      there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of
      Europe, often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000 francs.
      Caderousse entered hastily. Then, seeing that the room was, as usual,
      empty, and only guarded by the dog, he called to his wife, ‘Hello,
      Carconte,’ said he, ‘the worthy priest has not deceived us;
      the diamond is real.’ An exclamation of joy was heard, and the
      staircase creaked beneath a feeble step. ‘What do you say?’
      asked his wife, pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one
      of the first jewellers of Paris, will give us 50,000 francs for it. Only,
      in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to
      relate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which the
      diamond came into our possession. In the meantime please to sit down,
      monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.’ The jeweller
      examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of
      the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come
      from the casket of a prince. ‘Relate your story, madame,’ said
      he, wishing, no doubt, to profit by the absence of the husband, so that
      the latter could not influence the wife’s story, to see if the two
      recitals tallied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Oh,’ returned she, ‘it was a gift of heaven. My
      husband was a great friend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond
      Dantès. This poor fellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten
      him, and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him.’—‘But
      how did he obtain it?’ asked the jeweller; ‘had he it before
      he was imprisoned?’—‘No, monsieur; but it appears that
      in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich Englishman, and as in prison
      he fell sick, and Dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his
      brother, the Englishman, when he was set free, gave this stone to Dantès,
      who, less fortunate, died, and, in his turn, left it to us, and charged
      the excellent abbé, who was here this morning, to deliver it.’—‘The
      same story,’ muttered the jeweller; ‘and improbable as it
      seemed at first, it may be true. There’s only the price we are not
      agreed about.’—‘How not agreed about?’ said
      Caderousse. ‘I thought we agreed for the price I asked.’—‘That
      is,’ replied the jeweller, ‘I offered 40,000 francs.’—‘Forty
      thousand,’ cried La Carconte; ‘we will not part with it for
      that sum. The abbé told us it was worth 50,000. without the setting.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘What was the abbé’s name?’ asked the
      indefatigable questioner.—‘The Abbé Busoni,’ said La
      Carconte.—‘He was a foreigner?’—‘An Italian,
      from the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.’—‘Let me see
      this diamond again,’ replied the jeweller; ‘the first time you
      are often mistaken as to the value of a stone.’ Caderousse took from
      his pocket a small case of black shagreen, opened, and gave it to the
      jeweller. At the sight of the diamond, which was as large as a hazel-nut,
      La Carconte’s eyes sparkled with cupidity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?”
      said Monte Cristo; “did you credit it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency. I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man,
      and I thought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M.
      Bertuccio. Had you known this Edmond Dantès, of whom they spoke?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but
      once afterwards, and that was from the Abbé Busoni himself, when I saw him
      in the prison at Nîmes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of
      steel pliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of
      its setting, and weighed it carefully. ‘I will give you 45,000,’
      said he, ‘but not a sou more; besides, as that is the exact value of
      the stone, I brought just that sum with me.’—‘Oh, that’s
      no matter,’ replied Caderousse, ‘I will go back with you to
      fetch the other 5,000 francs.’—‘No,’ returned the
      jeweller, giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse—‘no,
      it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered so much, for the stone has a
      flaw in it, which I had not seen. However, I will not go back on my word,
      and I will give 45,000.’—‘At least, replace the diamond
      in the ring,’ said La Carconte sharply.—‘Ah, true,’
      replied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.—‘No matter,’
      observed Caderousse, replacing the box in his pocket, ‘someone else
      will purchase it.’—‘Yes,’ continued the jeweller;
      ‘but someone else will not be so easy as I am, or content himself
      with the same story. It is not natural that a man like you should possess
      such a diamond. He will inform against you. You will have to find the Abbé
      Busoni; and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare. The
      law would seize it, and put you in prison; if at the end of three or four
      months you are set at liberty, the ring will be lost, or a false stone,
      worth three francs, will be given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000
      or perhaps 55,000 francs; from which you must allow that one runs
      considerable risk in purchasing.’ Caderousse and his wife looked
      eagerly at each other.—‘No,’ said Caderousse, ‘we
      are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs.’—‘As you
      please, my dear sir,’ said the jeweller; ‘I had, however, as
      you see, brought you the money in bright coin.’ And he drew from his
      pocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of
      the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it
      was plain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over in
      his hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum
      which fascinated his gaze. He turned towards his wife. ‘What do you
      think of this?’ he asked in a low voice.—‘Let him have
      it—let him have it,’ she said. ‘If he returns to
      Beaucaire without the diamond, he will inform against us, and, as he says,
      who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoni?—in all
      probability we shall never see him.’—‘Well, then, so I
      will!’ said Caderousse; ‘so you may have the diamond for
      45,000 francs. But my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of silver
      buckles.’ The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box, which
      contained several samples of the articles demanded. ‘Here,’ he
      said, ‘I am very straightforward in my dealings—take your
      choice.’ The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and
      the husband a pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.—‘I
      hope you will not complain now?’ said the jeweller.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The abbé told me it was worth 50,000 francs,’ muttered
      Caderousse. ‘Come, come—give it to me! What a strange fellow
      you are,’ said the jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand.
      ‘I give you 45,000 francs—that is, 2,500 livres of income,—a
      fortune such as I wish I had myself, and you are not satisfied!’—‘And
      the five and forty thousand francs,’ inquired Caderousse in a hoarse
      voice, ‘where are they? Come—let us see them.’—‘Here
      they are,’ replied the jeweller, and he counted out upon the table
      15,000 francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in bank-notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Wait while I light the lamp,’ said La Carconte;
      ‘it is growing dark, and there may be some mistake.’ In fact,
      night had come on during this conversation, and with night the storm which
      had been threatening for the last half-hour. The thunder growled in the
      distance; but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller, Caderousse, or
      La Carconte, absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. I
      myself felt; a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold
      and all these bank-notes; it seemed to me that I was in a dream, and, as
      it always happens in a dream, I felt myself riveted to the spot.
      Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes, then handed
      them to his wife, who counted and counted them again in her turn. During
      this time, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the
      lamplight, and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of
      those which—precursors of the storm—began to play in at the
      windows. ‘Well,’ inquired the jeweller, ‘is the cash all
      right?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Yes,’ said Caderousse. ‘Give me the pocket-book,
      La Carconte, and find a bag somewhere.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “La Carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern
      pocket-book and a bag. From the former she took some greasy letters, and
      put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or three
      crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the entire
      fortune of the miserable couple. ‘There,’ said Caderousse;
      ‘and now, although you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs,
      will you have your supper with us? I invite you with good-will.’—‘Thank
      you,’ replied the jeweller, ‘it must be getting late, and I
      must return to Beaucaire—my wife will be getting uneasy.’ He
      drew out his watch, and exclaimed, ‘<i>Morbleu!</i> nearly nine o’clock—why,
      I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight! Good-night, my friends.
      If the Abbé Busoni should by any accident return, think of me.’—‘In
      another week you will have left Beaucaire,’ remarked Caderousse,
      ‘for the fair ends in a few days.’—‘True, but that
      makes no difference. Write to me at Paris, to M. Joannes, in the Palais
      Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45. I will make the journey on purpose to see
      him, if it is worth while.’ At this moment there was a tremendous
      clap of thunder, accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid, that it
      quite eclipsed the light of the lamp.

      “‘See here,’ exclaimed Caderousse. ‘You cannot
      think of going out in such weather as this.’—‘Oh, I am
      not afraid of thunder,’ said the jeweller.—‘And then
      there are robbers,’ said La Carconte. ‘The road is never very
      safe during fair time.’—‘Oh, as to the robbers,’
      said Joannes, ‘here is something for them,’ and he drew from
      his pocket a pair of small pistols, loaded to the muzzle. ‘Here,’
      said he, ‘are dogs who bark and bite at the same time, they are for
      the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond, Friend
      Caderousse.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. It
      seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some
      horrible thought. ‘Well, then, a good journey to you,’ said
      Caderousse.—‘Thanks,’ replied the jeweller. He then took
      his cane, which he had placed against an old cupboard, and went out. At
      the moment when he opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the
      lamp was nearly extinguished. ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘this is
      very nice weather, and two leagues to go in such a storm.’—‘Remain,’
      said Caderousse. ‘You can sleep here.’—‘Yes; do
      stay,’ added La Carconte in a tremulous voice; ‘we will take
      every care of you.’—‘No; I must sleep at Beaucaire. So,
      once more, good-night.’ Caderousse followed him slowly to the
      threshold. ‘I can see neither heaven nor earth,’ said the
      jeweller, who was outside the door. ‘Do I turn to the right, or to
      the left hand?’—‘To the right,’ said Caderousse.
      ‘You cannot go wrong—the road is bordered by trees on both
      sides.’—‘Good—all right,’ said a voice
      almost lost in the distance. ‘Close the door,’ said La
      Carconte; ‘I do not like open doors when it thunders.’—‘Particularly
      when there is money in the house, eh?’ answered Caderousse,
      double-locking the door.

      “He came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and
      pocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold and
      bank-notes. I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering
      lamp revealed in those two countenances. The woman, especially, was
      hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified, her countenance
      had become livid, and her eyes resembled burning coals. ‘Why,’
      she inquired in a hoarse voice, ‘did you invite him to sleep here
      tonight?’—‘Why?’ said Caderousse with a shudder;
      ‘why, that he might not have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire.’—‘Ah,’
      responded the woman, with an expression impossible to describe; ‘I
      thought it was for something else.’—‘Woman, woman—why
      do you have such ideas?’ cried Caderousse; ‘or, if you have
      them, why don’t you keep them to yourself?’—‘Well,’
      said La Carconte, after a moment’s pause, ‘you are not a man.’—‘What
      do you mean?’ added Caderousse.—‘If you had been a man,
      you would not have let him go from here.’—‘Woman!’—‘Or
      else he should not have reached Beaucaire.’—‘Woman!’—‘The
      road takes a turn—he is obliged to follow it—while alongside
      of the canal there is a shorter road.’—‘Woman!—you
      offend the good God. There—listen!’ And at this moment there
      was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the livid lightning illumined the
      room, and the thunder, rolling away in the distance, seemed to withdraw
      unwillingly from the cursed abode. ‘Mercy!’ said Caderousse,
      crossing himself.

      “At the same moment, and in the midst of the terrifying silence
      which usually follows a clap of thunder, they heard a knocking at the
      door. Caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other.
      ‘Who’s there?’ cried Caderousse, rising, and drawing up
      in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table, and which he
      covered with his two hands.—‘It is I,’ shouted a voice.—‘And
      who are you?’—‘Eh, <i>pardieu!</i> Joannes, the
      jeweller.’—‘Well, and you said I offended the good God,’
      said La Carconte with a horrid smile. ‘Why, the good God sends him
      back again.’ Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair. La
      Carconte, on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards the
      door, opened it, saying, as she did so—‘Come in, dear M.
      Joannes.’—‘<i>Ma foi</i>,’ said the jeweller,
      drenched with rain, ‘I am not destined to return to Beaucaire
      tonight. The shortest follies are best, my dear Caderousse. You offered me
      hospitality, and I accept it, and have returned to sleep beneath your
      friendly roof.’ Caderousse stammered out something, while he wiped
      away the sweat that started to his brow. La Carconte double-locked the
      door behind the jeweller.”

      it, if it were already awakened. Caderousse’s hands still grasped
      the gold and bank-notes, and La Carconte called up her sweetest smiles
      while welcoming the reappearance of their guest. ‘Well, well,’
      said the jeweller, ‘you seem, my good friends, to have had some
      fears respecting the accuracy of your money, by counting it over so
      carefully directly I was gone.’—‘Oh, no,’ answered
      Caderousse, ‘that was not my reason, I can assure you; but the
      circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so
      unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune, and it is only
      by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can
      persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream.’ The
      jeweller smiled.—‘Have you any other guests in your house?’
      inquired he.—‘Nobody but ourselves,’ replied Caderousse;
      ‘the fact is, we do not lodge travellers—indeed, our tavern is
      so near the town, that nobody would think of stopping here.’—‘Then
      I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you.’—‘Inconvenience
      us? Not at all, my dear sir,’ said La Carconte in her most gracious
      manner. ‘Not at all, I assure you.’—‘But where
      will you manage to stow me?’—‘In the chamber overhead.’—‘Surely
      that is where you yourselves sleep?’—‘Never mind that;
      we have a second bed in the adjoining room.’ Caderousse stared at
      his wife with much astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his
      back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her
      guest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his supper,
      by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on it the
      slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or four
      fresh-laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure—the
      banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put back into the
      bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He then began pacing
      the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from time to time at the
      jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes, and
      merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to enable the whole of his
      garments to be dried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘There,’ said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of
      wine on the table, ‘supper is ready whenever you are.’—‘And
      you?’ asked Joannes.—‘I don’t want any supper,’
      said Caderousse.—‘We dined so very late,’ hastily
      interposed La Carconte.—‘Then it seems I am to eat alone,’
      remarked the jeweller.—‘Oh, we shall have the pleasure of
      waiting upon you,’ answered La Carconte, with an eager attention she
      was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took.
    </p>
    <p>
      “From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching
      glances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued.
      ‘There, there,’ said La Carconte; ‘do you hear that?
      upon my word, you did well to come back.’—‘Nevertheless,’
      replied the jeweller, ‘if by the time I have finished my supper the
      tempest has at all abated, I shall make another start.’—‘It’s
      the mistral,’ said Caderousse, ‘and it will be sure to last
      till tomorrow morning.’ He sighed heavily.—‘Well,’
      said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table, ‘all I can say is,
      so much the worse for those who are abroad.’—‘Yes,’
      chimed in La Carconte, ‘they will have a wretched night of it.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was
      ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was
      suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had the
      unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously
      acquainted with her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited
      suspicion in his mind, or at least have greatly astonished him.
      Caderousse, meanwhile, continued to pace the room in gloomy silence,
      sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger
      had completed his repast, the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door
      and opened it. ‘I believe the storm is over,’ said he. But as
      if to contradict his statement, at that instant a violent clap of thunder
      seemed to shake the house to its very foundation, while a sudden gust of
      wind, mingled with rain, extinguished the lamp he held in his hand.
      Trembling and awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to
      his guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes
      that glimmered on the hearth. ‘You must be tired,’ said she to
      the jeweller; ‘I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed; go
      up when you are ready, and sleep well.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate
      in its fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that,
      instead of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily
      increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed inevitable, he
      bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He passed over my head
      and I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps. The quick, eager
      glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended, while Caderousse, on
      the contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even
      glancing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time
      as they have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the
      exception of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air of
      improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither
      apprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and fully
      purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I determined to
      obtain a few hours’ sleep. Overhead I could accurately distinguish
      every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best arrangements in
      his power for passing a comfortable night, threw himself on his bed, and I
      could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight. Insensibly my eyelids
      grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having no suspicion of anything
      wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked into the kitchen once more
      and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low
      wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of
      chairs; his back was turned towards me, so that I could not see the
      expression of his countenance—neither should I have been able to do
      so had he been placed differently, as his head was buried between his two
      hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time, then shrugging
      her shoulders, she took her seat immediately opposite to him. At this
      moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a
      piece of wood that lay near, and a bright light flashed over the room. La
      Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband, but as he made no sign
      of changing his position, she extended her hard, bony hand, and touched
      him on the forehead.

    <p>
      “Caderousse shuddered. The woman’s lips seemed to move, as
      though she were talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or
      my senses were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered.
      Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I fell
      into a deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this unconscious state
      I know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol,
      followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across
      the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull, heavy weight seemed to
      fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet fully recovered
      consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with half-stifled cries,
      as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A cry more prolonged than
      the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my
      drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself on one arm, I looked around, but
      all was dark; and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated
      through the flooring of the room above, for some kind of moisture appeared
      to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when I passed my hand across
      my brow, I felt that it was wet and clammy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most
      perfect silence—unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking
      about in the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the
      room below, approached the fire and lit a candle. The man was Caderousse—he
      was pale and his shirt was all bloody. Having obtained the light, he
      hurried upstairs again, and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy
      footsteps. A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the
      small shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the
      diamond,—seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in,
      then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he deposited
      it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round his head.
      After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had put
      there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and the other into
      that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of linen, and
      rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself
      with what had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed. I
      fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the unfortunate
      jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his relief, by way
      of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I had committed, but
      for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For this purpose I applied
      all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in
      which I lay to the adjoining room. The poorly fastened boards which alone
      divided me from it yielded to my efforts, and I found myself in the house.
      Hastily snatching up the lighted candle, I hurried to the staircase; about
      midway a body was lying quite across the stairs. It was that of La
      Carconte. The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at her. The shot
      had frightfully lacerated her throat, leaving two gaping wounds from
      which, as well as the mouth, the blood was pouring in floods. She was
      stone dead. I strode past her, and ascended to the sleeping chamber, which
      presented an appearance of the wildest disorder. The furniture had been
      knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there, and the
      sheets, to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were
      dragged across the room. The murdered man lay on the floor, his head
      leaning against the wall, and about him was a pool of blood which poured
      forth from three large wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in
      which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine—it was the
      second pistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet.
      I approached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my
      footsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed them on
      me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though trying to
      speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired. This appalling
      sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I could no longer be
      of service to anyone in the house, my only desire was to fly. I rushed
      towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and uttering a groan of horror.
      Upon reaching the room below, I found five or six custom-house officers,
      and two or three gendarmes—all heavily armed. They threw themselves
      upon me. I made no resistance; I was no longer master of my senses. When I
      strove to speak, a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party
      pointed to my blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and
      then I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I
      lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I
      pointed to the spot where I had concealed myself. ‘What does he
      mean?’ asked a gendarme. One of the officers went to the place I
      directed. ‘He means,’ replied the man upon his return, ‘that
      he got in that way;’ and he showed the hole I had made when I broke
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force
      and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me,
      while I managed to stammer forth—‘I did not do it! Indeed,
      indeed I did not!’ A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their
      carbines against my breast.—‘Stir but a step,’ said
      they, ‘and you are a dead man.’—‘Why should you
      threaten me with death,’ cried I, ‘when I have already
      declared my innocence?’—‘Tush, tush,’ cried the
      men; ‘keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at Nîmes.
      Meanwhile, come along with us; and the best advice we can give you is to
      do so unresistingly.’ Alas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I
      was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror; and without a word I
      suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse’s tail, and
      thus they took me to Nîmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me
      near the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there,
      he had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear
      the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such
      circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my
      innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of beseeching
      the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made
      for the Abbé Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on
      that morning. If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the
      diamond, and there existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni, then,
      indeed, I was lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the
      feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the
      whole truth. Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part,
      while I must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means
      to obtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he
      would. Caderousse still evaded all pursuit, and I had resigned myself to
      what seemed my inevitable fate. My trial was to come on at the approaching
      assizes; when, on the 8th of September—that is to say, precisely
      three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life—the
      Abbé Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I should see, presented
      himself at the prison doors, saying he understood one of the prisoners
      wished to speak to him; he added, that having learned at Marseilles the
      particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire. You
      may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how minutely I
      related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some degree of
      nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond, but, to my
      inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every particular, and to my
      equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief in all I said. And then
      it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was acquainted with
      all the habits and customs of my own country, and considering also that
      pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a
      double power from lips so benevolent and kind, I besought him to receive
      my confession, under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil affair in
      all its details, as well as every other transaction of my life. That which
      I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as
      though it had been the result of calculation. My voluntary confession of
      the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that
      of which I stood accused. When he quitted me, he bade me be of good
      courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges
      of my innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my
      behalf, for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling
      though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be
      postponed to the assizes following those now being held. In the interim it
      pleased providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse, who was
      discovered in some distant country, and brought back to France, where he
      made a full confession, refusing to make the fact of his wife’s
      having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt. The
      wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life, and I was immediately
      set at liberty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then it was, I presume,” said Monte Cristo “that
      you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the Abbé Busoni?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbé took an evident
      interest in all that concerned me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Your mode of life as a smuggler,’ said he to me one
      day, ‘will be the ruin of you; if you get out, don’t take it
      up again.’—‘But how,’ inquired I, ‘am I to
      maintain myself and my poor sister?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘A person, whose confessor I am,’ replied he, ‘and
      who entertains a high regard for me, applied to me a short time since to
      procure him a confidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I
      will give you a letter of introduction to him.’—‘Oh,
      father,’ I exclaimed, ‘you are very good.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason
      to repent my recommendation.’ I extended my hand, and was about to
      pledge myself by any promise he would dictate, but he stopped me. ‘It
      is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow,’ said he;
      ‘I know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you. Here,
      take this,’ continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I
      brought to your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to
      receive me into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency
      has ever had cause to repent having done so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the count; “I take pleasure in saying that
      you have served me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more
      confidence in me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I, your excellency?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted
      son, you have never spoken to me of either?”

      “Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my
      life. Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear
      sister, I lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at
      Rogliano I found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so
      horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting
      by my advice, my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable
      demands of Benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as
      long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession. One morning he
      threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him
      with what he desired, and disappeared and remained away all day, leaving
      the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he were her own child, to
      weep over his conduct and bewail his absence. Evening came, and still,
      with all the patient solicitude of a mother, she watched for his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air,
      attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions.
      She stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of
      the three—none other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed,—‘Put
      her to torture and she’ll soon tell us where her money is.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “It unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Wasilio, was at
      Bastia, leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature
      beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two
      held poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended to
      her, smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners.
      The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows, then returned, and
      the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of
      these preparations, and then dragged Assunta feet foremost towards the
      brazier, expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed
      treasure was secreted. In the struggle her clothes caught fire, and they
      were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from
      sharing the same fate. Covered with flames, Assunta rushed wildly to the
      door, but it was fastened; she flew to the windows, but they were also
      secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks; it was Assunta
      calling for help. The cries died away in groans, and next morning, as soon
      as Wasilio’s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad, she
      caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities,
      when Assunta, although dreadfully burnt, was found still breathing; every
      drawer and closet in the house had been forced open, and the money stolen.
      Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano, neither have I since that day
      either seen or heard anything concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your
      excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned Benedetto,
      since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister, since she
      was dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And in what light did you view the occurrence?” inquired
      Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a punishment for the crime I had committed,” answered
      Bertuccio. “Oh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Truly they are,” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now,” resumed Bertuccio, “your excellency may,
      perhaps, be able to comprehend that this place, which I revisit for the
      first time—this garden, the actual scene of my crime—must have
      given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature, and produced that
      gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your
      excellency, who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause. At this
      instant a shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now
      standing on the very grave in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand
      the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything is possible,” said Monte Cristo, rising from the
      bench on which he had been sitting; “even,” he added in an
      inaudible voice, “even that the procureur be not dead. The Abbé
      Busoni did right to send you to me,” he went on in his ordinary
      tone, “and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your
      history, as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning
      you in future. As for that Benedetto, who so grossly belied his name, have
      you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone, or what has
      become of him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I
      should shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank
      God, I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and
      believe he is dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not think so, Bertuccio,” replied the count; “for
      the wicked are not so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under
      his special watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So be it,” responded Bertuccio, “all I ask of heaven is
      that I may never see him again. And now, your excellency,” he added,
      bowing his head, “you know everything—you are my judge on
      earth, as the Almighty is in heaven; have you for me no words of
      consolation?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the
      Abbé Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,
      and, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the
      instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly
      punished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but one
      point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore, after
      rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its
      mother? There was the crime, Bertuccio—that was where you became
      really culpable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that I
      acted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in recalling
      the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in order to do so,
      I must have made close and careful inquiry, which would, in all
      probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung to life, partly
      on my sister’s account, and partly from that feeling of pride inborn
      in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the
      execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural and instinctive love
      of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own. And then, again, I am
      not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother.” Bertuccio hid
      his face in his hands as he uttered these words, while Monte Cristo fixed
      on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After a brief silence, rendered
      still more solemn by the time and place, the count said, in a tone of
      melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner, “In order to bring this
      conversation to a fitting termination (the last we shall ever hold upon
      this subject), I will repeat to you some words I have heard from the lips
      of the Abbé Busoni. For all evils there are two remedies—time and
      silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to walk alone here in the
      garden. The very circumstances which inflict on you, as a principal in the
      tragic scene enacted here, such painful emotions, are to me, on the
      contrary, a source of something like contentment, and serve but to enhance
      the value of this dwelling in my estimation. The chief beauty of trees
      consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs, while fancy
      pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing
      beneath that shade. Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to
      afford the fullest scope for the imagination, and furnished with thickly
      grown trees, beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may
      conjure up phantoms at will. This to me, who expected but to find a blank
      enclosure surrounded by a straight wall, is, I assure you, a most
      agreeable surprise. I have no fear of ghosts, and I have never heard it
      said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years
      as is wrought by the living in a single day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and
      tranquillize your mind. Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in
      your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni, send for me, if I am
      still on earth, and I will soothe your ears with words that shall
      effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to
      traverse the ocean called eternity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte
      Cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured,
      “Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant’s
      grave was dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this
      corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment.
      There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars, for
      there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me, I have the plan
      sketched with all the living reality of truth.” After making the
      tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered his carriage, while
      Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master’s
      features, took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word. The
      carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs-Élysées, the
      Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one
      long acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the
      party, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest
      error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to
      a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal
      attendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to
      Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make
      in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the attentive
      Nubian, “It is half-past eleven o’clock; Haydée will soon be
      here. Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming?”
      Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek,
      which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance,
      that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their
      existence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three fingers of
      his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut his eyes, and
      feigned to sleep. “I understand,” said Monte Cristo, well
      acquainted with Ali’s pantomime; “you mean to tell me that
      three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping-chamber.”
      Ali, with considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame will be tired tonight,” continued Monte Cristo,
      “and will, no doubt, wish to rest. Desire the French attendants not
      to weary her with questions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and
      retire. You will also see that the Greek servants hold no communication
      with those of this country.” He bowed. Just at that moment voices
      were heard hailing the concierge. The gate opened, a carriage rolled down
      the avenue, and stopped at the steps. The count hastily descended,
      presented himself at the already opened carriage door, and held out his
      hand to a young woman, completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily
      embroidered with gold. She raised the hand extended towards her to her
      lips, and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect. Some few words
      passed between them in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his
      gods converse. The young woman spoke with an expression of deep
      tenderness, while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity.
      Preceded by Ali, who carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the
      new-comer, who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte
      Cristo’s companion in Italy, was conducted to her apartments, while
      the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself. In another hour
      every light in the house was extinguished, and it might have been thought
      that all its inmates slept.

      Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout two o’clock
      the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses,
      stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person, dressed in a blue coat,
      with buttons of a similar color, a white waistcoat, over which was
      displayed a massive gold chain, brown trousers, and a quantity of black
      hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether
      it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with
      the deep wrinkles stamped on his features—a person, in a word, who,
      although evidently past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than
      forty, bent forwards from the carriage door, on the panels of which were
      emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to
      inquire at the porter’s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo
      resided there, and if he were within. While waiting, the occupant of the
      carriage surveyed the house, the garden as far as he could distinguish it,
      and the livery of servants who passed to and fro, with an attention so
      close as to be somewhat impertinent. His glance was keen but showed
      cunning rather than intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin
      that, as they closed, they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones
      were broad and projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and
      craftiness; while the flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the
      back of his skull, which rose much higher than his large and coarsely
      shaped ears, combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing,
      save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an
      equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable, more
      especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his
      shirt, and the red ribbon that depended from his button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the porter’s
      lodge, saying, “Pray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His excellency does reside here,” replied the concierge;
      “but——” added he, glancing an inquiring look at
      Ali. Ali returned a sign in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what?” asked the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      “His excellency does not receive visitors today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then here is my master’s card,—the Baron Danglars. You
      will take it to the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the
      Chamber, my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never speak to his excellency,” replied the concierge;
      “the valet de chambre will carry your message.” The groom
      returned to the carriage. “Well?” asked Danglars. The man,
      somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he had received, repeated what the
      concierge had said. “Bless me,” murmured Baron Danglars,
      “this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling
      him ‘excellency,’ and only venturing to address him by the
      medium of his valet de chambre. However, it does not signify; he has a
      letter of credit on me, so I must see him when he requires his money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to his
      coachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, “To the
      Chamber of Deputies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Apprised in time of the visit paid him, Monte Cristo had, from behind the
      blinds of his pavilion, as minutely observed the baron, by means of an
      excellent lorgnette, as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house,
      garden, and servants. “That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,”
      said the count in a tone of disgust, as he shut up his glass into its
      ivory case. “How comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at
      sight of that flat, receding, serpent-like forehead, round, vulture-shaped
      head, and sharp-hooked nose, like the beak of a buzzard? Ali,” cried
      he, striking at the same time on the brazen gong. Ali appeared. “Summon
      Bertuccio,” said the count. Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the
      apartment. “Did your excellency desire to see me?” inquired
      he. “I did,” replied the count. “You no doubt observed
      the horses standing a few minutes since at the door?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, your excellency. I noticed them for their remarkable
      beauty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then how comes it,” said Monte Cristo with a frown, “that,
      when I desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be
      found in Paris, there is another pair, fully as fine as mine, not in my
      stables?” At the look of displeasure, added to the angry tone in
      which the count spoke, Ali turned pale and held down his head. “It
      is not your fault, my good Ali,” said the count in the Arabic
      language, and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of
      showing, either in voice or face—“it is not your fault. You do
      not understand the points of English horses.” The countenance of
      poor Ali recovered its serenity. “Permit me to assure your
      excellency,” said Bertuccio, “that the horses you speak of
      were not to be sold when I purchased yours.” Monte Cristo shrugged
      his shoulders. “It seems, sir steward,” said he, “that
      you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to
      pay the price.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000
      francs for his horses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an
      opportunity of doubling his capital.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is your excellency really in earnest?” inquired the steward.
      Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with
      the look of one equally surprised and displeased. “I have to pay a
      visit this evening,” replied he. “I desire that these horses,
      with completely new harness, may be at the door with my carriage.”
      Bertuccio bowed, and was about to retire; but when he reached the door, he
      paused, and then said, “At what o’clock does your excellency
      wish the carriage and horses to be ready?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At five o’clock,” replied the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg your excellency’s pardon,” interposed the steward
      in a deprecating manner, “for venturing to observe that it is
      already two o’clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am perfectly aware of that fact,” answered Monte Cristo
      calmly. Then, turning towards Ali, he said, “Let all the horses in
      my stables be led before the windows of your young lady, that she may
      select those she prefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me
      by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be
      served in her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to
      come hither.” Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered
      the chamber. “Monsieur Baptistin,” said the count, “you
      have been in my service one year, the time I generally give myself to
      judge of the merits or demerits of those about me. You suit me very well.”
      Baptistin bowed low. “It only remains for me to know whether I also
      suit you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, your excellency!” exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen, if you please, till I have finished speaking,”
      replied Monte Cristo. “You receive 1,500 francs per annum for your
      services here—more than many a brave subaltern, who continually
      risks his life for his country, obtains. You live in a manner far superior
      to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money.
      Then, though yourself a servant, you have other servants to wait upon you,
      take care of your clothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for
      you. Again, you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my
      toilet, amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, indeed, your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not condemning you for this, Monsieur Baptistin; but let your
      profits end here. It would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative
      a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill. I neither ill-use
      nor ill-treat my servants by word or action. An error I readily forgive,
      but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never. My commands are ordinarily
      short, clear, and precise; and I would rather be obliged to repeat my
      words twice, or even three times, than they should be misunderstood. I am
      rich enough to know whatever I desire to know, and I can promise you I am
      not wanting in curiosity. If, then, I should learn that you had taken upon
      yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably, to comment on
      my actions, or watch my conduct, that very instant you would quit my
      service. You may now retire. I never caution my servants a second time—remember
      that.” Baptistin bowed, and was proceeding towards the door. “I
      forgot to mention to you,” said the count, “that I lay yearly
      aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment; those whom I am
      compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of course) all participation in
      this money, while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those
      domestics who remain with me, and among whom it will be divided at my
      death. You have been in my service a year, your fund has already begun to
      accumulate—let it continue to do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding one
      word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,
      produced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have
      occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics.
      “I assure your excellency,” said he, “that at least it
      shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things, and I will take
      M. Ali as my model.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By no means,” replied the count in the most frigid tones;
      “Ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities. He cannot
      possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a
      paid servant, but a mere slave—a dog, who, should he fail in his
      duty towards me, I should not discharge from my service, but kill.”
      Baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You seem incredulous,” said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali
      in the Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in
      French. The Nubian smiled assentingly to his master’s words, then,
      kneeling on one knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. This
      corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke
      to the wonder and stupefaction of M. Baptistin. The count then motioned
      the valet de chambre to retire, and to Ali to follow to his study, where
      they conversed long and earnestly together. As the hand of the clock
      pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong. When Ali was wanted
      one stroke was given, two summoned Baptistin, and three Bertuccio. The
      steward entered. “My horses,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency
      desired. Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go.” The count
      descended to the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage drawn by the
      very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property
      of Danglars. As he passed them he said—“They are extremely
      handsome certainly, and you have done well to purchase them, although you
      were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in
      obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,”
      inquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that I could wish.
      Whither does your excellency desire to be driven?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.”
      This conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which a
      flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive. As Bertuccio, with a
      respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back. “I have
      another commission for you, M. Bertuccio,” said he; “I am
      desirous of having an estate by the seaside in Normandy—for
      instance, between Le Havre and Boulogne. You see I give you a wide range.
      It will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small
      harbor, creek, or bay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at
      anchor. She draws only fifteen feet. She must be kept in constant
      readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal. Make the
      requisite inquiries for a place of this description, and when you have met
      with an eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the advantages desired,
      purchase it at once in your own name. The corvette must now, I think, be
      on her way to Fécamp, must she not?”

      “Certainly, your excellency; I saw her put to sea the same evening
      we quitted Marseilles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the yacht.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was ordered to remain at Martigues.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tis well. I wish you to write from time to time to the
      captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the steamboat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is at Châlons?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays
      of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency may depend upon me.” The Count made a gesture
      of satisfaction, descended the terrace steps, and sprang into his
      carriage, which was whirled along swiftly to the banker’s house.
      Danglars was engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad committee.
      But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was
      announced. As the count’s title sounded on his ear he rose, and
      addressing his colleagues, who were members of one or the other Chamber,
      he said,—“Gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly;
      but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred, which is this,—Thomson
      &amp; French, the Roman bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling
      himself the Count of Monte Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit
      with me. I confess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the
      course of my extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose
      it has greatly roused my curiosity. I took the trouble this morning to
      call on the pretended count—if he were a real count he wouldn’t
      be so rich. But, would you believe it, ‘He was not receiving.’
      So the master of Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great
      millionaire or a capricious beauty. I made inquiries, and found that the
      house in the Champs-Élysées is his own property, and certainly it was very
      decently kept up. But,” pursued Danglars with one of his sinister
      smiles, “an order for unlimited credit calls for something like
      caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given. I am very
      anxious to see this man. I suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators
      of it little knew whom they had to deal with. ‘They laugh best who
      laugh last!’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree of
      energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the assembled
      party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous furnishings of
      white and gold had caused a great sensation in the Chaussée d’Antin.
      It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown, with the
      purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury. He found the
      count standing before some copies of Albano and Fattore that had been
      passed off to the banker as originals; but which, mere copies as they
      were, seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition
      with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling. The count turned round as
      he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room. With a slight inclination
      of the head, Danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing
      significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered
      with gold. The count sat down. “I have the honor, I presume, of
      addressing M. de Monte Cristo.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      The count bowed. “And I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of
      the Legion of Honor, and member of the Chamber of Deputies?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron’s
      card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips. “You will, I trust,
      excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title when I first
      addressed you,” he said, “but you are aware that we are living
      under a popular form of government, and that I am myself a representative
      of the liberties of the people.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much so,” replied Monte Cristo, “that while you call
      yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word, monsieur,” said Danglars with affected
      carelessness, “I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions;
      but the fact is, I was made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of
      Honor, in return for services rendered, but——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by
      Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette? That was a noble example to follow,
      monsieur.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” replied Danglars, “not entirely so; with the
      servants,—you understand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see; to your domestics you are ‘my lord,’ the
      journalists style you ‘monsieur,’ while your constituents call
      you ‘citizen.’ These are distinctions very suitable under a
      constitutional government. I understand perfectly.” Again Danglars
      bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for Monte Cristo in an argument
      of this sort, and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more
      congenial.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Permit me to inform you, Count,” said he, bowing, “that
      I have received a letter of advice from Thomson &amp; French, of Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am glad to hear it, baron,—for I must claim the privilege
      of addressing you after the manner of your servants. I have acquired the
      bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country
      where barons are still barons by right of birth. But as regards the letter
      of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that will spare
      me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money
      myself. You have received a regular letter of advice?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Danglars, “but I confess I didn’t
      quite comprehend its meaning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in
      order to beg for an explanation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on, monsieur. Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you
      desire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” said Danglars, “in the letter—I believe I
      have it about me”—here he felt in his breast-pocket—“yes,
      here it is. Well, this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited
      credit on our house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Merely the term <i>unlimited</i>—nothing else, certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is not that word known in France? The people who wrote are
      Anglo-Germans, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be
      said; but as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have
      doubts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible?” asked the count, assuming all air and tone
      of the utmost simplicity and candor. “Is it possible that Thomson
      &amp; French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers? Pray tell me
      what you think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some
      considerable property in their hands.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thomson &amp; French are perfectly solvent,” replied
      Danglars, with an almost mocking smile: “but the word <i>unlimited</i>,
      in financial affairs, is so extremely vague.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is, in fact, unlimited,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely what I was about to say,” cried Danglars. “Now
      what is vague is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, ‘when in
      doubt, keep out.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Meaning to say,” rejoined Monte Cristo, “that however
      Thomson &amp; French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and
      folly, the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their example.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Plainly enough; Messrs. Thomson &amp; French set no bounds to their
      engagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise
      man, according to his own showing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” replied the banker, drawing himself up with a
      haughty air, “the extent of my resources has never yet been
      questioned.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems, then, reserved for me,” said Monte Cristo coldly,
      “to be the first to do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By what right, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations
      you have demanded, which certainly must have some motive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Danglars bit his lips. It was the second time he had been
      worsted, and this time on his own ground. His forced politeness sat
      awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence. Monte Cristo on
      the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a certain
      degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus possessed the
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir,” resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, “I
      will endeavor to make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me
      for what sum you propose to draw upon me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, truly,” replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an
      inch of the ground he had gained, “my reason for desiring an ‘unlimited’
      credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand. So
      throwing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and
      purse-proud air,—“Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming
      your wishes; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of
      Danglars, however limited, are still equal to meeting the largest demands;
      and were you even to require a million——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg your pardon,” interposed Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I said a million,” replied Danglars, with the confidence of
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But could I do with a million?” retorted the count. “My
      dear sir, if a trifle like that could suffice me, I should never have
      given myself the trouble of opening an account. A million? Excuse my
      smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my
      pocket-book or dressing-case.” And with these words Monte Cristo
      took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting-cards, and drew
      forth two orders on the treasury for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight
      to the bearer. A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler
      method of correction. The effect of the present revelation was stunning;
      he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy. The pupils of his eyes, as
      he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come,” said Monte Cristo, “confess honestly that
      you have not perfect confidence in Thomson &amp; French. I understand, and
      foreseeing that such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance
      of affairs, certain precautions. See, here are two similar letters to that
      you have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein &amp; Eskoles of
      Vienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon M.
      Lafitte. Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare you all
      uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two
      firms.” The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely
      vanquished; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count,
      who held them carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded to
      scrutinize the signatures, with a minuteness that the count might have
      regarded as insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to mislead
      the banker. “Oh, sir,” said Danglars, after he had convinced
      himself of the authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to
      salute the power of gold personified in the man before him,—“three
      letters of unlimited credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but you must
      pardon me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of astonishment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay,” answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air,
      “‘tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking
      house is to be incommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you
      not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” replied Monte Cristo, “since we mutually
      understand each other—for such I presume is the case?”
      Danglars bowed assentingly. “You are quite sure that not a lurking
      doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, my dear count,” exclaimed Danglars, “I never for an
      instant entertained such a feeling towards you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that
      we have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and
      suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable
      expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Six millions!” gasped Danglars—“so be it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, if I should require more,” continued Monte Cristo in a
      careless manner, “why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my
      present intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during
      that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned. However,
      we shall see. Be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs tomorrow. I
      shall be at home till midday, or if not, I will leave a receipt with my
      steward.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o’clock
      tomorrow morning, my dear count,” replied Danglars. “How would
      you like to have it? in gold, silver, or notes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please,”
      said the count, rising from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must confess to you, count,” said Danglars, “that I
      have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great
      fortunes of Europe, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown
      to me. May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It has been in the family a very long while,” returned Monte
      Cristo, “a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a
      certain period of years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled
      the capital. The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of
      these riches occurred only a short time ago, and they have only been
      employed by me within the last few years. Your ignorance on the subject,
      therefore, is easily accounted for. However, you will be better informed
      as to me and my possessions ere long.” And the count, while
      pronouncing these latter words, accompanied them with one of those ghastly
      smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz d’Epinay.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With your tastes, and means of gratifying them,” continued
      Danglars, “you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us
      poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade. If I mistake not you are
      an admirer of paintings, at least I judged so from the attention you
      appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the room. If you will
      permit me, I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed
      entirely of works by the ancient masters—warranted as such. Not a
      modern picture among them. I cannot endure the modern school of painting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great
      fault—that they have not yet had time to become old.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by
      Thorwaldsen, Bartoloni, and Canova?—all foreign artists, for, as you
      may perceive, I think but very indifferently of our French sculptors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your
      compatriots.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each
      other. For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to
      you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars—excuse my
      impatience, my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member
      of the family.” Monte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the
      proffered honor; Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy
      livery. “Is the baroness at home?” inquired Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my lord,” answered the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my lord, madame has visitors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame,
      or do you desire to preserve a strict <i>incognito</i>?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, indeed,” replied Monte Cristo with a smile, “I do
      not arrogate to myself the right of so doing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who is with madame?—M. Debray?” inquired Danglars,
      with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile,
      acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker’s domestic life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my lord,” replied the servant, “M. Debray is with
      madame.” Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo,
      said, “M. Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private
      secretary to the Minister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell
      you, she lowered herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the
      most ancient families in France. Her maiden name was De Servières, and her
      first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already
      met M. Lucien Debray.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed?” said Danglars; “and where was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the house of M. de Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, ha, you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, true,” cried Danglars. “Let me see; have I not
      heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins,
      and of his having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he
      used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his
      return from Italy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,” said the
      servant, who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress. “With
      your permission,” said Danglars, bowing, “I will precede you,
      to show you the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By all means,” replied Monte Cristo; “I follow you.”

      Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he baron, followed
      by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the
      prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of
      ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglars—a
      small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered with white
      Indian muslin. The chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials; over
      the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses, after the
      style and manner of Boucher; and at each side pretty medallions in
      crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment,
      the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste
      prevailed. The truth was, it had been entirely overlooked in the plan
      arranged and followed out by M. Danglars and his architect, who had been
      selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because
      he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day. The
      decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars
      and Lucien Debray. M. Danglars, however, while possessing a great
      admiration for the antique, as it was understood during the time of the
      Directory, entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance
      of his wife’s favorite sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never
      permitted to intrude, unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by
      ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had
      rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced, than
      that of being the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or
      frigid, in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please
      or displease the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still
      strikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate piece
      of cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before a small
      work-table, was turning over the pages of an album. Lucien had found time,
      preparatory to the count’s arrival, to relate many particulars
      respecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be remembered that Monte Cristo
      had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at
      the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf; and although Debray was not in
      the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never been able to shake
      off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and
      manner of the count, consequently the description given by Lucien to the
      baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own heated imagination.
      Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by De
      Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to, and
      fully credited, all the additional circumstances detailed by Debray. This
      posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by
      way of precaution. A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed
      on M. Danglars; the count, in return for his gentlemanly bow, received a
      formal though graceful courtesy, while Lucien exchanged with the count a
      sort of distant recognition, and with Danglars a free and easy nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Baroness,” said Danglars, “give me leave to present to
      you the Count of Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me
      by my correspondents at Rome. I need but mention one fact to make all the
      ladies in Paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take up
      his abode in Paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes to
      spend six millions of money. That means balls, dinners, and lawn parties
      without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember us, as he may
      depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble entertainments.” In
      spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address, Madame
      Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man
      capable of expending six millions in twelve months, and who had selected
      Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance. “And when did you
      arrive here?” inquired she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yesterday morning, madame.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Coming, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe?
      Pardon me—at least, such I have heard is your custom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, madame. This time I have merely come from Cadiz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit.
      Paris is a horrible place in summer. Balls, parties, and <i>fêtes</i> are
      over; the Italian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere except
      in Paris. As for the Théatre Français, you know, of course, that it is
      nowhere. The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the
      Champ-de-Mars and Satory. Do you propose entering any horses at either of
      these races, count?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good
      fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of
      amusement.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you fond of horses, count?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame,
      and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things—the
      fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, count,” said the baroness, “it would have been
      somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a
      preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.” At this
      instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir;
      approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone. Madame
      Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed,—“I cannot believe
      it; the thing is impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I assure you, madame,” replied the woman, “it is as I
      have said.” Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars
      demanded, “Is this true?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is what true, madame?” inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What my maid tells me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what does she tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my
      carriage, he discovered that they had been removed from the stables
      without his knowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,” said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear
      what explanation you will give. These two gentlemen shall decide between
      us; but, first, I will state the case to them. Gentlemen,” continued
      the baroness, “among the ten horses in the stables of Baron
      Danglars, are two that belong exclusively to me—a pair of the
      handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in Paris. But to you,
      at least, M. Debray, I need not give a further description, because to you
      my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known. Well, I had promised
      Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois;
      but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are
      gone—positively gone. No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them to
      the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs. Oh,
      what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” replied Danglars, “the horses were not
      sufficiently quiet for you; they were scarcely four years old, and they
      made me extremely uneasy on your account.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense,” retorted the baroness; “you could not have
      entertained any alarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware
      that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris.
      But, perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise
      you another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and
      steady.” The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of
      ineffable contempt, while her husband, affecting not to observe this
      unconjugal gesture, turned towards Monte Cristo and said,—“Upon
      my word, count, I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner. You are
      setting up an establishment, of course?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, yes,” replied the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses. I
      have almost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was
      anxious to get rid of them upon any terms. They were only fit for a young
      man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,” said
      Monte Cristo; “but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of
      carriage-horses, and I do not think they were dear. There they are. Come,
      M. Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your opinion upon
      them.” As Debray walked towards the window, Danglars approached his
      wife. “I could not tell you before others,” said he in a low
      tone, “the reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous
      price was offered me this morning for them. Some madman or fool, bent upon
      ruining himself as fast as he can, actually sent his steward to me to
      purchase them at any cost; and the fact is, I have gained 16,000 francs by
      the sale of them. Come, don’t look so angry, and you shall have
      4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with, and Eugénie shall have
      2,000. There, what do you think now of the affair? Wasn’t I right to
      part with the horses?” Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a
      look of withering contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Great heavens?” suddenly exclaimed Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?” asked the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! The very animals we
      were speaking of, harnessed to the count’s carriage!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dappled grays?” demanded the baroness, springing to the
      window. “‘Tis indeed they!” said she. Danglars looked
      absolutely stupefied. “How very singular,” cried Monte Cristo
      with well-feigned astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot believe it,” murmured the banker. Madame Danglars
      whispered a few words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo,
      saying, “The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for
      the horses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I scarcely know,” replied the count; “it was a little
      surprise prepared for me by my steward, and cost me—well, somewhere
      about 30,000 francs.” Debray conveyed the count’s reply to the
      baroness. Poor Danglars looked so crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte
      Cristo assumed a pitying air towards him. “See,” said the
      count, “how very ungrateful women are. Your kind attention, in
      providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses, does
      not seem to have made the least impression on her. But so it is; a woman
      will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which is dangerous to that
      which is safe. Therefore, in my opinion, my dear baron, the best and
      easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and allow them to act as
      they please, and then, if any mischief follows, why, at least, they have
      no one to blame but themselves.” Danglars made no reply; he was
      occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the
      baroness, whose frowning brow, like that of Olympic Jove, predicted a
      storm. Debray, who perceived the gathering clouds, and felt no desire to
      witness the explosion of Madame Danglars’ rage, suddenly recollected
      an appointment, which compelled him to take his leave; while Monte Cristo,
      unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to
      obtain, made a farewell bow and departed, leaving Danglars to endure the
      angry reproaches of his wife.

    <p>
      “Excellent,” murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came
      away. “All has gone according to my wishes. The domestic peace of
      this family is henceforth in my hands. Now, then, to play another
      master-stroke, by which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife—delightful!
      Still,” added he, “amid all this, I have not yet been
      presented to Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars, whose acquaintance I should
      have been glad to make. But,” he went on with his peculiar smile,
      “I am here in Paris, and have plenty of time before me—by and
      by will do for that.” With these reflections he entered his carriage
      and returned home. Two hours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most
      flattering epistle from the count, in which he entreated her to receive
      back her favorite “dappled grays,” protesting that he could
      not endure the idea of making his entry into the Parisian world of fashion
      with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the
      price of a lovely woman’s regrets. The horses were sent back wearing
      the same harness she had seen on them in the morning; only, by the count’s
      orders, in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their
      heads, had been fastened a large diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote, requesting him to excuse the
      whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to
      pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening, Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil, accompanied by
      Ali. The following day, about three o’clock, a single blow struck on
      the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count. “Ali,”
      observed his master, as the Nubian entered the chamber, “you have
      frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in
      throwing the lasso, have you not?” Ali drew himself up proudly, and
      then returned a sign in the affirmative. “I thought I did not
      mistake. With your lasso you could stop an ox?” Again Ali repeated
      his affirmative gesture. “Or a tiger?” Ali bowed his head in
      token of assent. “A lion even?” Ali sprung forwards, imitating
      the action of one throwing the lasso, then of a strangled lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I understand,” said Monte Cristo; “you wish to tell me
      you have hunted the lion?” Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he
      signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions. “But
      do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing
      forwards with ungovernable fury?” The Nubian smiled. “It is
      well,” said Monte Cristo. “Then listen to me. Ere long a
      carriage will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you
      saw me with yesterday; now, at the risk of your own life, you must manage
      to stop those horses before my door.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ali descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement
      immediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line he
      had traced to the count, who was watching him. The count patted him gently
      on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased and
      gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a
      projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating
      himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte Cristo
      re-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.
      Still, as five o’clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily
      expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and
      uneasiness might be observed in his manner. He stationed himself in a room
      commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless steps,
      stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching
      wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but the regularity with
      which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at
      least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation.
      Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and almost
      immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild, ungovernable
      horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their
      furious speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight
      clasped in each other’s arms. Terror seemed to have deprived them
      even of the power of uttering a cry. The carriage creaked and rattled as
      it flew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels
      would have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road, and
      those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,
      threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its
      triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the
      violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which
      snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.
      Gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from his
      box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse, and
      held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain, sunk
      beside his companion. All this was achieved in much less time than is
      occupied in the recital. The brief space had, however, been sufficient for
      a man, followed by a number of servants, to rush from the house before
      which the accident had occurred, and, as the coachman opened the door of
      the carriage, to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the
      cushions with one hand, while with the other she pressed to her bosom the
      young boy, who had lost consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo carried them both to the salon, and deposited them on a sofa.
      “Compose yourself, madame,” said he; “all danger is
      over.” The woman looked up at these words, and, with a glance far
      more expressive than any entreaties could have been, pointed to her child,
      who still continued insensible. “I understand the nature of your
      alarms, madame,” said the count, carefully examining the child,
      “but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for
      uneasiness; your little charge has not received the least injury; his
      insensibility is merely the effects of terror, and will soon pass.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears? See
      how deadly pale he is! My child, my darling Edward; speak to your mother—open
      your dear eyes and look on me once again! Oh, sir, in pity send for a
      physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery
      of my boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to
      the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening a
      casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass incrusted
      with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of which he let fall
      a single drop on the child’s lips. Scarcely had it reached them, ere
      the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his eyes, and eagerly gazed
      around him. At this, the delight of the mother was almost frantic. “Where
      am I?” exclaimed she; “and to whom am I indebted for so happy
      a termination to my late dreadful alarm?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” answered the count, “you are under the roof of
      one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you
      from a further continuance of your sufferings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My wretched curiosity has brought all this about,” pursued
      the lady. “All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars’
      beautiful horses, and I had the folly to desire to know whether they
      really merited the high praise given to them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible,” exclaimed the count with well-feigned
      astonishment, “that these horses belong to the baroness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They do, indeed. May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame
      Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger
      that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the
      unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred.
      I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the baroness
      evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them back to
      her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my
      hands.”

    <p>
      “You are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom
      Hermine has talked to me so much?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have rightly guessed, madame,” replied the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I am Madame Héloïse de Villefort.” The count bowed with
      the air of a person who hears a name for the first time. “How
      grateful will M. de Villefort be for all your goodness; how thankfully
      will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife
      and child! Most certainly, but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid
      servant, this dear child and myself must both have perished.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of
      your man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beseech you, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “not to
      spoil Ali, either by too great praise or rewards. I cannot allow him to
      acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling
      service he may render. Ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but
      discharging his duty to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay,” interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the
      authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression, “nay,
      but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my
      having myself saved him from death.” Madame de Villefort made no
      further reply; her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the
      person who, from the first instant she saw him, had made so powerful an
      impression on her. During the evident preoccupation of Madame de
      Villefort, Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy
      she kept folded in her arms, lavishing on him the most tender endearments.
      The child was small for his age, and unnaturally pale. A mass of straight
      black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his
      projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased
      vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and
      fondness for every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth was large, and the lips,
      which had not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact,
      the deep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child’s
      face, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young.
      His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the
      encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket from
      whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without asking
      permission of anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a spoiled
      child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to pull the corks
      out of all the bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Touch nothing, my little friend,” cried the count eagerly;
      “some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to
      inhale.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son’s arm,
      drew him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also
      cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost upon
      the count. At this moment Ali entered. At sight of him Madame de Villefort
      uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child still closer
      towards her, she said, “Edward, dearest, do you see that good man?
      He has shown very great courage and resolution, for he exposed his own
      life to stop the horses that were running away with us, and would
      certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces. Thank him, then, my child,
      in your very best manner; for, had he not come to our aid, neither you nor
      I would have been alive to speak our thanks.” The child stuck out
      his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner, saying, “He’s
      too ugly.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while
      Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation
      very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.
      “This lady,” said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic
      language, “is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both
      their lives; but the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.” Ali
      turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed
      without any apparent emotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils
      showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded
      to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you permit me to inquire,” said Madame de Villefort, as
      she arose to take her leave, “whether you usually reside here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I do not,” replied Monte Cristo; “it is a small
      place I have purchased quite lately. My place of abode is No. 30, Avenue
      des Champs-Élysées; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright,
      and are, no doubt, desirous of returning home. Anticipating your wishes, I
      have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my
      carriages, and Ali, he whom you think so very ugly,” continued he,
      addressing the boy with a smiling air, “will have the honor of
      driving you home, while your coachman remains here to attend to the
      necessary repairs of your calash. As soon as that important business is
      concluded, I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it
      direct to Madame Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I dare not return with those dreadful horses,” said Madame de
      Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will see,” replied Monte Cristo, “that they will be
      as different as possible in the hands of Ali. With him they will be gentle
      and docile as lambs.” Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for,
      approaching the animals, who had been got upon their legs with
      considerable difficulty, he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a
      sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that
      covered their mouths. Then, commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed
      them well all over their bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by
      the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed
      the pacified animals to the count’s chariot, took the reins in his
      hands, and mounted the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who
      had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same
      horses, he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle
      manner before he could induce them to start; and even then all that could
      be obtained from the celebrated “dappled grays,” now changed
      into a couple of dull, sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering
      pace, kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more
      than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.

      Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been
      gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Hermine,—I have just had a wonderful escape from the
      most imminent danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte
      Cristo we were talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see
      today. I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your
      eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause to
      admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far
      short of his merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they darted
      forward like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that
      there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of
      being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their
      progress, when a strange-looking man,—an Arab, a negro, or a Nubian,
      at least a black of some nation or other—at a signal from the count,
      whose domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals,
      even at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must
      have had a most wonderful escape. The count then hastened to us, and took
      us into his house, where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life. He
      sent us home in his own carriage. Yours will be returned to you tomorrow.
      You will find your horses in bad condition, from the results of this
      accident; they seem thoroughly stupefied, as if sulky and vexed at having
      been conquered by man. The count, however, has commissioned me to assure
      you that two or three days’ rest, with plenty of barley for their
      sole food during that time, will bring them back to as fine, that is as
      terrifying, a condition as they were in yesterday. Adieu! I cannot return
      you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but, after all, I ought not to
      blame you for the misconduct of your horses, more especially as it
      procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo,—and
      certainly that illustrious personage, apart from the millions he is said
      to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed to me one of those curiously
      interesting problems I, for one, delight in solving at any risk, even if
      it were to necessitate another drive to the Bois behind your horses.
      Edward endured the accident with miraculous courage—he did not utter
      a single cry, but fell lifeless into my arms; nor did a tear fall from his
      eyes after it was over. I doubt not you will consider these praises the
      result of blind maternal affection, but there is a soul of iron in that
      delicate, fragile body. Valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to
      your dear Eugénie. I embrace you with all my heart.

      Héloïse de Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.—Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte
      Cristo at your house. I must and will see him again. I have just made M.
      de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere. Albert
      related it to his mother; Château-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey Club,
      and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister; even
      Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the
      count’s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the
      greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the
      aristocracy. Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left
      their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort, with the design of
      renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her lips all the
      interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of Héloïse to the
      letter,—donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves,
      ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery,
      and drove that same night to No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.

      Chapter 48. Ideology
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f the Count of
      Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of Parisian
      society, he would have appreciated better the significance of the step
      which M. de Villefort had taken. Standing well at court, whether the king
      regnant was of the older or younger branch, whether the government was
      doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked upon by all as a man of
      talent, since those who have never experienced a political check are
      generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly supported by others,
      without being really liked by anybody, M. de Villefort held a high
      position in the magistracy, and maintained his eminence like a Harlay or a
      Molé. His drawing-room, under the regenerating influence of a young wife
      and a daughter by his first marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of
      the well-regulated Paris salons where the worship of traditional customs
      and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained. A
      freezing politeness, a strict fidelity to government principles, a
      profound contempt for theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of
      ideality,—these were the elements of private and public life
      displayed by M. de Villefort.

    <p>
      M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.
      His Relations with the former court, of which he always spoke with dignity
      and respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so many
      things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but sometimes
      consulted. Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get
      rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who rebelled against
      their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress. This fortress was
      his post as king’s attorney, all the advantages of which he
      exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have resigned but
      to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.
      Ordinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits. His wife
      visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the
      weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an
      excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of
      professed superiority—in fact, the application of the axiom, <i>Pretend
      to think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you</i>, an
      axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the
      Greeks, “Know thyself,” a knowledge for which, in our days, we
      have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of <i>knowing
      others</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies,
      he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were neither the one
      nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man. He had a haughty
      bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and
      inquisitorial. Four successive revolutions had built and cemented the
      pedestal upon which his fortune was based. M. de Villefort had the
      reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in
      France. He gave a ball every year, at which he appeared for a quarter of
      an hour only,—that is to say, five and forty minutes less than the
      king is visible at his balls. He was never seen at the theatres, at
      concerts, or in any place of public resort. Occasionally, but seldom, he
      played at whist, and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him—sometimes
      they were ambassadors, sometimes archbishops, or sometimes a prince, or a
      president, or some dowager duchess. Such was the man whose carriage had
      just now stopped before the Count of Monte Cristo’s door. The valet
      de chambre announced M. de Villefort at the moment when the count, leaning
      over a large table, was tracing on a map the route from St. Petersburg to
      China.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have
      employed in entering a court of justice. He was the same man, or rather
      the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as assistant
      attorney at Marseilles. Nature, according to her way, had made no
      deviation in the path he had marked out for himself. From being slender he
      had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his deep-set eyes
      were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an
      integral portion of his face. He dressed entirely in black, with the
      exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance was only mitigated
      by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through
      his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a
      delicate brush. Although master of himself, Monte Cristo, scrutinized with
      irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned, and who,
      distrustful by habit, and especially incredulous as to social prodigies,
      was much more despised to look upon “the noble stranger,” as
      Monte Cristo was already called, as an adventurer in search of new fields,
      or an escaped criminal, rather than as a prince of the Holy See, or a
      sultan of the Thousand and One Nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by
      magistrates in their oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will
      not, divest themselves in society, “sir, the signal service which
      you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to
      offer you my thanks. I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and
      to express to you my overwhelming gratitude.” And as he said this,
      the “eye severe” of the magistrate had lost nothing of its
      habitual arrogance. He spoke in a voice of the procureur-general, with the
      rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to
      say (as we have before observed) that he was the living statue of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” replied the count, with a chilling air, “I
      am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother,
      for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and
      the good fortune which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to
      dispense with a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great
      honor; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the
      favor which he now bestows on me,—a favor which, however estimable,
      is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness.”
      Villefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected,
      started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor
      he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment
      he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by
      no means a highly bred gentleman. He glanced around, in order to seize on
      something on which the conversation might turn, and seemed to fall easily
      on a topic. He saw the map which Monte Cristo had been examining when he
      entered, and said, “You seem geographically engaged, sir? It is a
      rich study for you, who, as I learn, have seen as many lands as are
      delineated on this map.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” replied the count; “I have sought to make of
      the human race, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on
      individuals—a physiological study. I have believed it was much
      easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to
      the whole. It is an algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known
      to an unknown quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down,
      sir, I beg of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take
      the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back
      into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered.
      Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back
      towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which
      furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,—a conversation
      which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and Morcerf,
      a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation. “Ah, you
      philosophize,” replied Villefort, after a moment’s silence,
      during which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he took
      breath; “well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to do,
      I should seek a more amusing occupation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, in truth, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s reply, “man
      is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar
      microscope; but you said, I think, that I had nothing else to do. Now,
      really, let me ask, sir, have you?—do you believe you have anything
      to do? or to speak in plain terms, do you really think that what you do
      deserves being called anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort’s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly
      made by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the magistrate had
      heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly, it
      was the first time he had ever heard of it. The procureur exerted himself
      to reply. “Sir,” he responded, “you are a stranger, and
      I believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in
      Oriental countries, so you are not aware how human justice, so expeditious
      in barbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and well-studied course.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes—yes, I do, sir; it is the <i>pede claudo</i> of the
      ancients. I know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries
      especially that I have occupied myself—it is with the criminal
      procedure of all nations that I have compared natural justice, and I must
      say, sir, that it is the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of
      retaliation, that I have most frequently found to be according to the law
      of God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If this law were adopted, sir,” said the procureur, “it
      would greatly simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates
      would not (as you just observed) have much to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It may, perhaps, come to this in time,” observed Monte
      Cristo; “you know that human inventions march from the complex to
      the simple, and simplicity is always perfection.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the meanwhile,” continued the magistrate, “our codes
      are in full force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from
      Gallic customs, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which,
      you will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs
      tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong
      power of brain to retain it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with
      respect to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code,
      but as regards the codes of all nations. The English, Turkish, Japanese,
      Hindu laws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and thus I was
      right, when I said to you, that relatively (you know that everything is
      relative, sir)—that relatively to what I have done, you have very
      little to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you have yet a
      great deal to learn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But with what motive have you learned all this?” inquired
      Villefort, in astonishment. Monte Cristo smiled. “Really, sir,”
      he observed, “I see that in spite of the reputation which you have
      acquired as a superior man, you look at everything from the material and
      vulgar view of society, beginning with man, and ending with man—that
      is to say, in the most restricted, most narrow view which it is possible
      for human understanding to embrace.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray, sir, explain yourself,” said Villefort, more and more
      astonished, “I really do—not—understand you—perfectly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of
      nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the
      sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize before
      you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions have
      been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom God has put above
      those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to
      follow out, instead of a post to fill—I say that they escape your
      narrow, limited field of observation. It is thus that human weakness
      fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs. Tobias took the angel
      who restored him to light for an ordinary young man. The nations took
      Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror similar to other
      conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions, that
      they might be known and acknowledged; one was compelled to say, ‘I
      am the angel of the Lord’; and the other, ‘I am the hammer of
      God,’ in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really
      supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman, “you consider
      yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why not?” said Monte Cristo coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your pardon, sir,” replied Villefort, quite astounded,
      “but you will excuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was
      unaware that I should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding
      so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men. It is not
      usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like
      yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune—at least, so it
      is said—and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely
      repeat;—it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy
      beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in
      philosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has
      disinherited from the goods of this world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, sir,” retorted the count, “have you attained
      the eminent situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even
      without having met with exceptions? and do you never use your eyes, which
      must have acquired so much <i>finesse</i> and certainty, to divine, at a
      glance, the kind of man by whom you are confronted? Should not a
      magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most
      crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to
      search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled
      with more or less of alloy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Villefort, “upon my word, you overcome me. I
      really never heard a person speak as you do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general
      conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper
      spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked
      and invisible beings mingle amongst us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why should they not? Can you see the air you breathe, and yet
      without which you could not for a moment exist?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to
      assume a material form. You touch them, come in contact with them, speak
      to them, and they reply to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Villefort, smiling, “I confess I should like
      to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned
      just now, and I now again warn you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found
      himself in a position similar to mine. The dominions of kings are limited
      either by mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of
      language. My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an
      Italian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard—I
      am a cosmopolite. No country can say it saw my birth. God alone knows what
      country will see me die. I adopt all customs, speak all languages. You
      believe me to be a Frenchman, for I speak French with the same facility
      and purity as yourself. Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab;
      Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Haydée, my slave, thinks me a
      Greek. You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no country, asking no
      protection from any government, acknowledging no man as my brother, not
      one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the obstacles which
      paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me. I have only two adversaries—I
      will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I subdue even them,—they
      are time and distance. There is a third, and the most terrible—that
      is my condition as a mortal being. This alone can stop me in my onward
      career, before I have attained the goal at which I aim, for all the rest I
      have reduced to mathematical terms. What men call the chances of fate—namely,
      ruin, change, circumstances—I have fully anticipated, and if any of
      these should overtake me, yet it will not overwhelm me. Unless I die, I
      shall always be what I am, and therefore it is that I utter the things you
      have never heard, even from the mouths of kings—for kings have need,
      and other persons have fear of you. For who is there who does not say to
      himself, in a society as incongruously organized as ours, ‘Perhaps
      some day I shall have to do with the king’s attorney’?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But can you not say that, sir? The moment you become an inhabitant
      of France, you are naturally subjected to the French law.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “but when I visit
      a country I begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men
      from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well
      as, perhaps better than, they know themselves. It follows from this, that
      the king’s attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to
      deal, would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is to say,” replied Villefort with hesitation, “that
      human nature being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed
      faults.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Faults or crimes,” responded Monte Cristo with a negligent
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as
      your brothers—for you have said so,” observed Villefort in a
      tone that faltered somewhat—“you alone are perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, not perfect,” was the count’s reply; “only
      impenetrable, that’s all. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if
      the tone of it is displeasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your
      justice than are you by my second-sight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,—by no means,” said Villefort, who was afraid of
      seeming to abandon his ground. “No; by your brilliant and almost
      sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no
      longer talk, we rise to dissertation. But you know how the theologians in
      their collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies,
      occasionally say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we are
      theologizing in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will say to
      you, rude as it may seem, ‘My brother, you sacrifice greatly to
      pride; you may be above others, but above you there is God.’”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Above us all, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s response, in a
      tone and with an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered.
      “I have my pride for men—serpents always ready to threaten
      everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot. But I lay aside
      that pride before God, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, count, I admire you,” said Villefort, who, for the
      first time in this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the
      unknown personage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur. “Yes,
      and I say to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious,
      or impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing—then
      be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of predominance. Yet you
      have unquestionably some ambition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what may it be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by
      Satan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed me
      all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to me,
      ‘Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?’
      I reflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and then
      I replied, ‘Listen,—I have always heard of Providence, and yet
      I have never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make
      me believe that he exists. I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that
      the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to
      recompense and punish.’ Satan bowed his head, and groaned. ‘You
      mistake,’ he said, ‘Providence does exist, only you have never
      seen him, because the child of God is as invisible as the parent. You have
      seen nothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs, and
      moves by hidden ways. All I can do for you is to make you one of the
      agents of that Providence.’ The bargain was concluded. I may
      sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?” added Monte Cristo. “If
      the thing were to do again, I would again do it.” Villefort looked
      at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement. “Count,” he inquired,
      “have you any relations?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir, I am alone in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the worse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?” asked Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down
      your pride. You say you fear nothing but death?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could
      check the execution of my plans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And old age?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My end will be achieved before I grow old.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And madness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,—<i>non bis in
      idem</i>. It is an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you
      understand its full application.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Sir,” continued Villefort, “there is something to fear
      besides death, old age, and madness. For instance, there is apoplexy—that
      lightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which
      brings everything to an end. You are still yourself as now, and yet you
      are yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are but
      an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this is
      called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than
      apoplexy. Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation at
      my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of
      understanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father, M.
      Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French
      Revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity, seconded
      by a most powerful organization—a man who has not, perhaps, like
      yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to
      overturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like
      you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of
      Providence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on the
      lobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an hour,
      but in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the old
      Jacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the guillotine,
      the cannon, and the dagger—M. Noirtier, playing with revolutions—M.
      Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from which pawns, rooks,
      knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the king was checkmated—M.
      Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning <i>poor M. Noirtier</i>,
      the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the
      household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine; a dumb and frozen carcass,
      in fact, living painlessly on, that time may be given for his frame to
      decompose without his consciousness of its decay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, sir,” said Monte Cristo “this spectacle is
      neither strange to my eye nor my thought. I am something of a physician,
      and have, like my fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living
      and in dead matter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my
      eyes, although present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates,
      Seneca, St. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the
      comparison you have made, and yet I can well understand that a father’s
      sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on
      you, sir, since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride,
      this terrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow
      to your family.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large
      a compensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to
      the tomb, are two children just entering into life—Valentine, the
      daughter by my first wife—Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran—and
      Edward, the boy whose life you have this day saved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?”
      inquired Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My deduction is,” replied Villefort, “that my father,
      led away by his passions, has committed some fault unknown to human
      justice, but marked by the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy
      to punish but one person, has visited this justice on him alone.”
      Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his soul a
      groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it. “Adieu,
      sir,” said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; “I
      leave you, bearing a remembrance of you—a remembrance of esteem,
      which I hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for
      I am not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have
      made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.” The count bowed, and
      contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet, the
      procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a signal
      from their master, followed him with every mark of attention. When he had
      gone, Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh, and said,—“Enough
      of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.” Then sounding his
      bell, he said to Ali, who entered, “I am going to madam’s
      chamber—have the carriage ready at one o’clock.”

      Chapter 49. Haydée
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t will be
      recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the Count of
      Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other than Maximilian,
      Julie, and Emmanuel. The very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in
      his forthcoming visits—the bright, pure gleam of heavenly happiness
      it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily
      engaged, illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and
      calmness, as, immediately after Villefort’s departure, his thoughts
      flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting, at least, a
      brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind. Even Ali,
      who had hastened to obey the Count’s summons, went forth from his
      master’s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and
      pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while, as
      though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his
      patron’s meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked
      on tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound
      should dissipate his master’s happy reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the
      apartments of Haydée, as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once
      admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a gradual
      succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full
      and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be
      inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations. The
      young Greek, as we have already said, occupied apartments wholly
      unconnected with those of the count. The rooms had been fitted up in
      strict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were covered with the
      richest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung with brocaded silk of
      the most magnificent designs and texture; while around each chamber
      luxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and yielding cushions,
      that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as
      sought repose. Haydée had three French maids, and one who was a Greek. The
      first three remained constantly in a small waiting-room, ready to obey the
      summons of a small golden bell, or to receive the orders of the Romaic
      slave, who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistress’s
      wishes to the three other waiting-women; the latter had received most
      peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Haydée with all the
      deference they would observe to a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the
      farther end of her apartments. This was a sort of boudoir, circular, and
      lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass. Haydée
      was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin spotted
      with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms,
      rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the other was employed
      in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile, through whose
      flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed
      water. Her attitude, though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would,
      in a European, have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after
      effect. Her dress, which was that of the women of Epirus, consisted of a
      pair of white satin trousers, embroidered with pink roses, displaying feet
      so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair, that they might well have
      been taken for Parian marble, had not the eye been undeceived by their
      movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little
      slippers with upturned toes, beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls.
      She wore a blue and white-striped vest, with long open sleeves, trimmed
      with silver loops and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice, which,
      closing only from the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole of the
      ivory throat and upper part of the bosom; it was fastened with three
      magnificent diamond clasps. The junction of the bodice and drawers was
      entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves, whose brilliant
      hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of
      Parisian belles. Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of
      gold-colored silk, embroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple
      rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of
      which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue. The
      extreme beauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness that
      mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly and purely
      Grecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the finely formed nose,
      the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to her race and country.
      And, to complete the whole, Haydée was in the very springtide and fulness
      of youthful charms—she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or
      twenty summers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether it
      would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit. Haydée’s
      only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried
      curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir, the framework of the
      opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau
      presented by the young girl’s picturesque attitude and appearance.
      As Monte Cristo approached, she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held
      the narghile, and extending to him her other hand, said, with a smile of
      captivating sweetness, in the sonorous language spoken by the women of
      Athens and Sparta, “Why demand permission ere you enter? Are you no
      longer my master, or have I ceased to be your slave?” Monte Cristo
      returned her smile. “Haydée,” said he, “you well know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you address me so coldly—so distantly?” asked
      the young Greek. “Have I by any means displeased you? Oh, if so,
      punish me as you will; but do not—do not speak to me in tones and
      manner so formal and constrained.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Haydée,” replied the count, “you know that you are now
      in France, and are free.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Free to do what?” asked the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Free to leave me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leave you? Why should I leave you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not for me to say; but we are now about to mix in society—to
      visit and be visited.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t wish to see anybody but you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And should you see one whom you could prefer, I would not be so
      unjust——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have never seen anyone I preferred to you, and I have never loved
      anyone but you and my father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My poor child,” replied Monte Cristo, “that is merely
      because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t want anybody else to talk to me. My father said I was
      his ‘joy’—you style me your ‘love,’—and
      both of you have called me ‘my child.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you remember your father, Haydée?” The young Greek smiled.
      “He is here, and here,” said she, touching her eyes and her
      heart. “And where am I?” inquired Monte Cristo laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You?” cried she, with tones of thrilling tenderness, “you
      are everywhere!” Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young
      girl in his, and was about to raise it to his lips, when the simple child
      of nature hastily withdrew it, and presented her cheek. “You now
      understand, Haydée,” said the count, “that from this moment
      you are absolutely free; that here you exercise unlimited sway, and are at
      liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country, as it may
      suit your inclination. Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of
      your actions, and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem
      most agreeable to you. A carriage waits your orders, and Ali and Myrto
      will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go. There is but one favor
      I would entreat of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guard carefully the secret of your birth. Make no allusion to the
      past; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your
      illustrious father or ill-fated mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have already told you, my lord, that I shall see no one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is possible, Haydée, that so perfect a seclusion, though
      conformable with the habits and customs of the East, may not be
      practicable in Paris. Endeavor, then, to accustom yourself to our manner
      of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome, Florence,
      Milan, and Madrid; it may be useful to you one of these days, whether you
      remain here or return to the East.” The young girl raised her
      tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said with touching earnestness,
      “Whether <i>we</i> return to the East, you mean to say, my lord, do
      you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My child,” returned Monte Cristo “you know full well
      that whenever we part, it will be no fault or wish of mine; the tree
      forsakes not the flower—the flower falls from the tree.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My lord,” replied Haydée, “I never will leave you, for
      I am sure I could not exist without you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My poor girl, in ten years I shall be old, and you will be still
      young.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father had a long white beard, but I loved him; he was sixty
      years old, but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then tell me, Haydée, do you believe you shall be able to accustom
      yourself to our present mode of life?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I see you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Every day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what do you fear, my lord?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You might find it dull.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my lord. In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of
      your coming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have
      enjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty
      pictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering
      mountains of Pindus and Olympus. Oh, believe me, that when three great
      passions, such as sorrow, love, and gratitude fill the heart, <i>ennui</i>
      can find no place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are a worthy daughter of Epirus, Haydée, and your charming and
      poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who
      claim your country as their birthplace. Depend on my care to see that your
      youth is not blighted, or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude; and
      of this be well assured, that if you love me as a father, I love you as a

      “You are wrong, my lord. The love I have for you is very different
      from the love I had for my father. My father died, but I did not die. If
      you were to die, I should die too.” The Count, with a smile of
      profound tenderness, extended his hand, and she carried it to her lips.
      Monte Cristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with
      Morrel and his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of
      Pindar, “Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he
      who, after having watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and
      call it his own.” The carriage was prepared according to orders, and
      stepping lightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.

      Chapter 50. The Morrel Family
    </h2>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n a very few
      minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The house was of white
      stone, and in a small court before it were two small beds full of
      beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate the count
      recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye had become
      somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not recognize the
      count. The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn, to
      avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork,—an ornament
      that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter, and had gained for the
      place the appellation of <i>The Little Versailles</i>. It is needless to
      add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin. The house, with
      kitchens and cellars below, had above the ground floor, two stories and
      attics. The whole of the property, consisting of an immense workshop, two
      pavilions at the bottom of the garden, and the garden itself, had been
      purchased by Emmanuel, who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a
      profitable speculation. He had reserved the house and half the garden, and
      building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had let them upon
      lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden. So that for a
      trifling sum he was as well lodged, and as perfectly shut out from
      observation, as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the Faubourg St.
      Germain. The breakfast-room was finished in oak; the salon in mahogany,
      and the furnishings were of blue velvet; the bedroom was in citronwood and
      green damask. There was a study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a
      music-room for Julie, who never played. The whole of the second story was
      set apart for Maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sister’s
      apartments, except that for the breakfast-parlor he had a billiard-room,
      where he received his friends. He was superintending the grooming of his
      horse, and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden, when the count’s
      carriage stopped at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cocles opened the gate, and Baptistin, springing from the box, inquired
      whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel would
      see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo. “The Count of Monte
      Cristo?” cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and hastening to the
      carriage; “I should think we would see him. Ah, a thousand thanks,
      count, for not having forgotten your promise.” And the young officer
      shook the count’s hand so warmly, that Monte Cristo could not be
      mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw that he had been
      expected with impatience, and was received with pleasure. “Come,
      come,” said Maximilian, “I will serve as your guide; such a
      man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant. My sister is in
      the garden plucking the dead roses; my brother is reading his two papers,
      <i>la Presse</i> and <i>les Débats</i>, within six steps of her; for
      wherever you see Madame Herbault, you have only to look within a circle of
      four yards and you will find M. Emmanuel, and ‘reciprocally,’
      as they say at the Polytechnic School.” At the sound of their steps
      a young woman of twenty to five and twenty, dressed in a silk morning
      gown, and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette
      rose-tree, raised her head. This was Julie, who had become, as the clerk
      of the house of Thomson &amp; French had predicted, Madame Emmanuel
      Herbault. She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger, and
      Maximilian began to laugh. “Don’t disturb yourself, Julie,”
      said he. “The count has only been two or three days in Paris, but he
      already knows what a fashionable woman of the Marais is, and if he does
      not, you will show him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, monsieur,” returned Julie, “it is treason in my
      brother to bring you thus, but he never has any regard for his poor
      sister. Penelon, Penelon!” An old man, who was digging busily at one
      of the beds, stuck his spade in the earth, and approached, cap in hand,
      striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A
      few locks of gray mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted,
      while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor
      who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics.
      “I think you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?” said he. Penelon
      had still preserved the habit of calling his master’s daughter
      “Mademoiselle Julie,” and had never been able to change the
      name to Madame Herbault. “Penelon,” replied Julie, “go
      and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman’s visit, and Maximilian
      will conduct him to the salon.” Then, turning to Monte Cristo,—“I
      hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes,” continued
      she; and without awaiting any reply, disappeared behind a clump of trees,
      and escaped to the house by a lateral alley.

      “I am sorry to see,” observed Monte Cristo to Morrel, “that
      I cause no small disturbance in your house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look there,” said Maximilian, laughing; “there is her
      husband changing his jacket for a coat. I assure you, you are well known
      in the Rue Meslay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your family appears to be a very happy one,” said the count,
      as if speaking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render
      them happy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to
      each other, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy
      themselves as rich as Rothschild.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however,”
      replied Monte Cristo, with a tone so sweet and gentle, that it went to
      Maximilian’s heart like the voice of a father; “but they will
      not be content with that. Your brother-in-law is a barrister? a doctor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of
      my poor father. M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were
      divided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children. Her
      husband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his noble
      probity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation, wished to
      possess as much as his wife. He labored and toiled until he had amassed
      250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object. Oh, I assure
      you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures,
      destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling together, and
      through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal
      house, taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would
      have effected in two or three. Marseilles resounded with their well-earned
      praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife, who had just
      finished making up the accounts. ‘Julie,’ said he to her,
      ‘Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs; that
      completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains. Can
      you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the
      future? Listen to me. Our house transacts business to the amount of a
      million a year, from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs. We can
      dispose of the business, if we please, in an hour, for I have received a
      letter from M. Delaunay, in which he offers to purchase the good-will of
      the house, to unite with his own, for 300,000 francs. Advise me what I had
      better do.’—‘Emmanuel,’ returned my sister,
      ‘the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel. Is it not
      worth 300,000 francs to save our father’s name from the chances of
      evil fortune and failure?’—‘I thought so,’ replied
      Emmanuel; ‘but I wished to have your advice.’—‘This
      is my counsel:—Our accounts are made up and our bills paid; all we
      have to do is to stop the issue of any more, and close our office.’
      This was done instantly. It was three o’clock; at a quarter past, a
      merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit of
      15,000 francs. ‘Monsieur,’ said Emmanuel, ‘have the
      goodness to address yourself to M. Delaunay. We have quitted business.’—‘How
      long?’ inquired the astonished merchant. ‘A quarter of an
      hour,’ was the reply. And this is the reason, monsieur,”
      continued Maximilian, “of my sister and brother-in-law having only
      25,000 francs a year.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      Maximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count’s
      heart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and
      coat. He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank
      of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the little
      garden, he returned to the house. A large vase of Japan porcelain, filled
      with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume, stood in the salon.
      Julie, suitably dressed, and her hair arranged (she had accomplished this
      feat in less than ten minutes), received the count on his entrance. The
      songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by, and the branches of
      laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue
      velvet curtains. Everything in this charming retreat, from the warble of
      the birds to the smile of the mistress, breathed tranquillity and repose.
      The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he
      entered the house, and he remained silent and pensive, forgetting that he
      was expected to renew the conversation, which had ceased after the first
      salutations had been exchanged. The silence became almost painful when, by
      a violent effort, tearing himself from his pleasing reverie,
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” said he at length, “I pray you to excuse my
      emotion, which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness
      I meet here; but contentment is so new a sight to me, that I could never
      be weary of looking at yourself and your husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are very happy, monsieur,” replied Julie; “but we
      have also known unhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter
      sufferings than ourselves.” The Count’s features displayed an
      expression of the most intense curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, all this is a family history, as Château-Renaud told you the
      other day,” observed Maximilian. “This humble picture would
      have but little interest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the
      pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as
      we are, we have experienced bitter sorrows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And God has poured balm into your wounds, as he does into those of
      all who are in affliction?” said Monte Cristo inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, count,” returned Julie, “we may indeed say he has,
      for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one
      of his angels.” The count’s cheeks became scarlet, and he
      coughed, in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his
      mouth. “Those born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying
      every wish,” said Emmanuel, “know not what is the real
      happiness of life, just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters
      of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair
      weather.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness of
      his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the
      apartment with a slow step.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our magnificence makes you smile, count,” said Maximilian,
      who had followed him with his eyes. “No, no,” returned Monte
      Cristo, pale as death, pressing one hand on his heart to still its
      throbbings, while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover, beneath
      which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion. “I was wondering
      what could be the significance of this purse, with the paper at one end
      and the large diamond at the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count,” replied Maximilian, with an air of gravity, “those
      are our most precious family treasures.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The stone seems very brilliant,” answered the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, my brother does not allude to its value, although it has been
      estimated at 100,000 francs; he means, that the articles contained in this
      purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation,
      madame,” replied Monte Cristo bowing. “Pardon me, I had no
      intention of committing an indiscretion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indiscretion,—oh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse
      for expatiating on this subject. If we wanted to conceal the noble action
      this purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view. Oh, would
      we could relate it everywhere, and to everyone, so that the emotion of our
      unknown benefactor might reveal his presence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, really,” said Monte Cristo in a half-stifled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur,” returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and
      respectfully kissing the silken purse, “this has touched the hand of
      a man who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from
      shame and disgrace,—a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor
      children, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear everyone
      envying our happy lot. This letter” (as he spoke, Maximilian drew a
      letter from the purse and gave it to the count)—“this letter
      was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate
      resolution, and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my
      sister as her dowry.” Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it
      with an indescribable feeling of delight. It was the letter written (as
      our readers know) to Julie, and signed “Sinbad the Sailor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unknown you say, is the man who rendered you this service—unknown
      to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,”
      continued Maximilian. “We have supplicated heaven in vain to grant
      us this favor, but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we
      cannot comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand,—a
      hand as powerful as that of an enchanter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” cried Julie, “I have not lost all hope of some day
      kissing that hand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four
      years ago, Penelon was at Trieste—Penelon, count, is the old sailor
      you saw in the garden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener—Penelon,
      when he was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the
      point of embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person
      who called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this
      letter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity, but
      he did not venture to address him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An Englishman,” said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the
      attention with which Julie looked at him. “An Englishman you say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Maximilian, “an Englishman, who
      represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson
      &amp; French, at Rome. It was this that made me start when you said the
      other day, at M. de Morcerf’s, that Messrs. Thomson &amp; French
      were your bankers. That happened, as I told you, in 1829. For God’s
      sake, tell me, did you know this Englishman?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson &amp; French have
      constantly denied having rendered you this service?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who,
      grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself
      had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was his name?” asked Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He gave no other name,” answered Julie, looking earnestly at
      the count, “than that at the end of his letter—‘Sinbad
      the Sailor.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me,” continued he, “was he not about my height,
      perhaps a little taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high
      cravat; his coat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his
      pencil?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, do you then know him?” cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled
      with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” returned Monte Cristo “I only guessed. I knew a
      Lord Wilmore, who was constantly doing actions of this kind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without revealing himself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of
      gratitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, heaven,” exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, “in
      what did he believe, then?”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,” said
      Monte Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie’s voice;
      “but, perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does
      exist.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?” inquired Emmanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, if you do know him,” cried Julie, “can you tell us
      where he is—where we can find him? Maximilian—Emmanuel—if
      we do but discover him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!”
      Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily
      up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the name of heaven,” said Maximilian, “if you know
      anything of him, tell us what it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion,
      “if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never
      see him again. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then
      on the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he
      will never return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,” said Julie, much
      affected; and the young lady’s eyes swam with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly
      on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julie’s cheeks, “had
      Lord Wilmore seen what I now see, he would become attached to life, for
      the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind;” and he held out
      his hand to Julie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent
      of the count. “But,” continued she, “Lord Wilmore had a
      family or friends, he must have known someone, can we not——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is useless to inquire,” returned the count; “perhaps,
      after all, he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no
      secrets from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And he told you nothing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not a word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing that would lead you to suppose?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet you spoke of him at once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, in such a case one supposes——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sister, sister,” said Maximilian, coming to the count’s
      aid, “monsieur is quite right. Recollect what our excellent father
      so often told us, ‘It was no Englishman that thus saved us.’”
      Monte Cristo started. “What did your father tell you, M. Morrel?”
      said he eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed—he
      believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us. Oh, it
      was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself
      believe it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father’s
      faith. How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear
      friend—a friend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the
      near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with
      supernatural light, this thought, which had until then been but a doubt,
      became a conviction, and his last words were, ‘Maximilian, it was
      Edmond Dantès!’” At these words the count’s paleness,
      which had for some time been increasing, became alarming; he could not
      speak; he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour, said
      a few hurried words to Madame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel
      and Maximilian,—“Madame,” said he, “I trust you
      will allow me to visit you occasionally; I value your friendship, and feel
      grateful to you for your welcome, for this is the first time for many
      years that I have thus yielded to my feelings;” and he hastily
      quitted the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,” said Emmanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” answered Maximilian, “but I feel sure he has an
      excellent heart, and that he likes us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His voice went to my heart,” observed Julie; “and two
      or three times I fancied that I had heard it before.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout two-thirds of
      the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and in the rear of one of the
      most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood, where the various houses
      vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of
      construction, extended a large garden, where the wide-spreading
      chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart,
      and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink
      and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two
      square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate, that dated from the
      time of Louis XIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and the
      graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved
      their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet
      bloom, had fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of the mansion had
      many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession
      of the house itself, with its thickly planted courtyard, opening into the
      Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and to the garden shut in by this gate, which
      formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre. For the
      demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a street, at
      the farther side of the kitchen-garden. The street was laid out, a name
      was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before construction was
      begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum
      might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by
      building along the line of the proposed street, and so making it a branch
      of communication with the Faubourg Saint-Honoré itself, one of the most
      important thoroughfares in the city of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In matters of speculation, however, though “man proposes,”
      “money disposes.” From some such difficulty the newly named
      street died almost in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden,
      having paid a high price for it, and being quite unable to find anyone
      willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet
      still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a
      sum for it that would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also
      the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented
      himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a
      yearly rental of 500 francs. And so, as we have said, the iron gate
      leading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust,
      which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges, while to prevent the
      ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to
      sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had
      been boarded up to a height of six feet. True, the planks were not so
      closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their
      interstices; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants
      of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be
      taken of that circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted
      kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, peas, and melons
      had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its
      being deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from the
      walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the ground
      having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and had now
      fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the
      one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house the
      chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall, without
      in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that
      eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as though asserting
      their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one corner, where the
      foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a large stone bench and
      sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in
      general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house, which was
      faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially
      concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary
      of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the
      choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the screen
      it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no entrance
      there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the incessant and
      melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from either the noise
      of the street or the bustle of the mansion. On the evening of one of the
      warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris, might be
      seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench, a book, a parasol, and a
      work-basket, from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief,
      while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman, standing
      close to the iron gate, endeavoring to discern something on the other side
      by means of the openings in the planks,—the earnestness of her
      attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of
      her wishes, proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter.
      At that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to the
      street was noiselessly opened, and a tall, powerful young man appeared. He
      was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully
      arranged hair, beard and moustache, all of the richest and glossiest
      black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire. After casting a rapid glance
      around him, in order to assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered
      by the small gate, and, carefully closing and securing it after him,
      proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume,
      the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty retreat.
      But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow chinks of
      the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and observed the
      fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close to the planks, he
      exclaimed, “Don’t be alarmed, Valentine—it is I!”
      Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she
      did so, “And why do you come so late today? It is almost
      dinner-time, and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my
      watchful mother-in-law, my too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother,
      who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am
      in a fair way never to get done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you
      can for having made me wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a
      dress so singular that at first I did not recognize you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dearest Valentine,” said the young man, “the difference
      between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of
      my love, but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to
      pour forth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to
      carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even
      thank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if you
      did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose),
      at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my being late,
      and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the reason of both, and
      I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have chosen a trade.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have
      such deep cause for uneasiness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me
      than life itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all
      about it. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and
      seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering
      about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a
      thief. That would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing
      of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place
      where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well
      create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted
      the costume of my calling.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my
      life by such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually screen
      our meetings from all suspicion or danger.”

    <p>
      “I beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what
      you really mean.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I
      stand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by the
      proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucern. Think of that,
      Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut
      on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you. Only imagine
      what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely contain myself at the
      bare idea. Such felicity seems above all price—as a thing impossible
      and unattainable. But would you believe that I purchase all this delight,
      joy, and happiness, for which I would cheerfully have surrendered ten
      years of my life, at the small cost of 500 francs per annum, paid
      quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to fear. I am on my own ground, and
      have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall, and to look
      over when I please, without having any apprehensions of being taken off by
      the police as a suspicious character. I may also enjoy the precious
      privilege of assuring you of my fond, faithful, and unalterable affection,
      whenever you visit your favorite bower, unless, indeed, it offends your
      pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman,
      clad in a blouse and cap.” A faint cry of mingled pleasure and
      surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine, who almost instantly said, in
      a saddened tone, as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which
      illumined her heart, “Alas, no, Maximilian, this must not be, for
      many reasons. We should presume too much on our own strength, and, like
      others, perhaps, be led astray by our blind confidence in each other’s
      prudence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear
      Valentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance,
      schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you
      have, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke to me
      of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger, I placed
      myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other reward than
      the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since, by word or
      look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers
      that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you? You told me, my
      dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d’Epinay, and that your
      father was resolved upon completing the match, and that from his will
      there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known to change a
      determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you wished, and
      waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but hoping that
      Providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and order events in
      our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties, Valentine, as long
      as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity on me? If you will only
      repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and
      which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask
      myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my
      mother-in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as I
      now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings,
      so fraught with danger to both.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will not admit that word,” returned the young man; “it
      is at once cruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive
      slave than myself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to
      time, Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or
      elsewhere—have I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this
      inclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate—to be
      close to you without really seeing you—have I ever asked so much as
      to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a
      trifle to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a murmur
      escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of
      olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what I say is
      true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust.”

    <p>
      “It is true,” said Valentine, as she passed the end of her
      slender fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted
      Maximilian to press his lips to them, “and you are a true and
      faithful friend; but still you acted from motives of self-interest, my
      dear Maximilian, for you well knew that from the moment in which you had
      manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You
      promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have
      no friend but yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my
      father, harassed and persecuted by my mother-in-law, and left to the sole
      companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered hand
      can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone,
      although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his
      poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as a
      victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my only
      friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed, Maximilian, I am
      very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of pity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Valentine,” replied the young man, deeply affected, “I
      will not say you are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister
      and brother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no
      manner resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart beats
      fast, the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but I
      solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and intensity
      of feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render them available
      in serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to return home for a
      year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable and unforeseen
      chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the best; hope is so sweet
      a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while reproaching me with selfishness,
      think a little what you have been to me—the beautiful but cold
      resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise of future reward have you made
      me for all the submission and obedience I have evinced?—none
      whatever. What granted me?—scarcely more. You tell me of M. Franz d’Epinay,
      your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the idea of being his wife; but
      tell me, Valentine, is there no other sorrow in your heart? You see me
      devoted to you, body and soul, my life and each warm drop that circles
      round my heart are consecrated to your service; you know full well that my
      existence is bound up in yours—that were I to lose you I would not
      outlive the hour of such crushing misery; yet you speak with calmness of
      the prospect of your being the wife of another! Oh, Valentine, were I in
      your place, and did I feel conscious, as you do, of being worshipped,
      adored, with such a love as mine, a hundred times at least should I have
      passed my hand between these iron bars, and said, ‘Take this hand,
      dearest Maximilian, and believe that, living or dead, I am yours—yours
      only, and forever!’” The poor girl made no reply, but her
      lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears. A rapid change took place in
      the young man’s feelings. “Dearest, dearest Valentine,”
      exclaimed he, “forgive me if I have offended you, and forget the
      words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Maximilian, I am not offended,” answered she, “but
      do you not see what a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an
      outcast in my father’s house, where even he is seldom seen; whose
      will has been thwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years,
      beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and
      persecuted, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has
      cared for, even observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word
      on the subject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I
      am surrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The
      general remark is, ‘Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a
      character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on
      their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender age,
      she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de Villefort.’
      The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from utter
      indifference, while my mother-in-law detests me with a hatred so much the
      more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hate you, sweet Valentine,” exclaimed the young man; “how
      is it possible for anyone to do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” replied the weeping girl, “I am obliged to own
      that my mother-in-law’s aversion to me arises from a very natural
      source—her overweening love for her own child, my brother Edward.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why should it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters
      into our present conversation, I will just say this much—that her
      extreme dislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me
      the fortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than
      doubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-Méran, whose sole heiress I
      am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for being so
      richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of this wealth
      for the happiness of at least sharing my father’s love. God knows, I
      would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me a happy and
      affectionate home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor Valentine!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the
      same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the
      restraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too, my
      father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity;
      protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation
      for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him; he is
      all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word. Dear
      Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to
      resist my father’s commands it is more on your account than my own.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,—why
      picture so gloomy a future?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I judge it from the past.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what
      is termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons, not
      altogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such distinctions
      were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in France, and the
      first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire.
      The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the
      cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class; and certainly my prospects
      of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain. My
      fortune, though small, is free and unfettered, and the memory of my late
      father is respected in our country, Valentine, as that of the most upright
      and honorable merchant of the city; I say our country, because you were
      born not far from Marseilles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one
      word brings back my mother to my recollection—my angel mother, who
      died too soon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching
      over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now,
      I fondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were
      still living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would tell
      her that I loved you, and she would protect us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I fear, Valentine,” replied the lover, “that were she
      living I should never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would
      then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a
      thought on me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,” cried Valentine;
      “but there is one thing I wish to know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is that?” inquired the young man, perceiving that
      Valentine hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers
      dwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not that I am aware of,” replied the young man, “unless,
      indeed, any ill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite
      parties—your father was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the
      Bourbons, while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not
      possibly be any other difference between them. But why do you ask?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will tell you,” replied the young girl, “for it is
      but right you should know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an
      officer of the Legion of honor was announced in the papers, we were all
      sitting with my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also—you
      recollect M. Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses
      ran away with my mother-in-law and little brother, and very nearly killed
      them? While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching
      marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my
      grandfather; but when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had
      done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you know you
      had told me all about it the previous evening), I felt so happy, and yet
      so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many
      people, that I really think I should have passed it over, but for the fear
      that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so
      I summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as I
      could.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Dear Valentine!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of
      your name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I
      was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the
      utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start,
      and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have been
      a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Morrel, Morrel,’ cried my father, ‘stop a bit;’
      then knitting his brows into a deep frown, he added, ‘surely this
      cannot be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so
      much trouble from their violent Bonapartism—I mean about the year
      1815.’—‘Yes,’ replied M. Danglars, ‘I
      believe he is the son of the old shipowner.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed,” answered Maximilian; “and what did your father
      say then, Valentine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don’t dare to tell you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Always tell me everything,” said Maximilian with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Ah,’ continued my father, still frowning, ‘their
      idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them
      ‘food for powder,’ which was precisely all they were good for;
      and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this
      salutary principle with all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for
      nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into
      practice, it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain.
      Though it certainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in
      that uncivilized country.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brutal politics, I must confess.” said Maximilian; “but
      don’t attach any serious importance, dear, to what your father said.
      My father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. ‘Why,’
      said he, ‘does not the emperor, who has devised so many clever and
      efficient modes of improving the art of war, organize a regiment of
      lawyers, judges and legal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire
      the enemy could maintain, and using them to save better men?’ You
      see, my dear, that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit
      there is not much to choose between the language of either party. But what
      did M. Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself—half-malicious,
      half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up and took his leave; then, for
      the first time, I observed the agitation of my grandfather, and I must
      tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only person capable of discerning
      emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I suspected that the conversation that
      had been carried on in his presence (for they always say and do what they
      like before the dear old man, without the smallest regard for his
      feelings) had made a strong impression on his mind; for, naturally enough,
      it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and
      served spoken of in that depreciating manner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The name of M. Noirtier,” interposed Maximilian, “is
      celebrated throughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you
      may or may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every
      Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the Bourbons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most
      strange—the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have
      been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics? But
      to resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to question
      him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively at the
      newspaper I had been reading. ‘What is the matter, dear grandfather?’
      said I, ‘are you pleased?’ He gave me a sign in the
      affirmative. ‘With what my father said just now?’ He returned
      a sign in the negative. ‘Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?’
      Another sign in the negative. ‘Oh, then, you were glad to hear that
      M. Morrel (I didn’t dare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer
      of the Legion of Honor?’ He signified assent; only think of the poor
      old man’s being so pleased to think that you, who were a perfect
      stranger to him, had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps
      it was a mere whim on his part, for he is falling, they say, into second
      childhood, but I love him for showing so much interest in you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How singular,” murmured Maximilian; “your father hates
      me, while your grandfather, on the contrary—What strange feelings
      are aroused by politics.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush,” cried Valentine, suddenly; “someone is coming!”
      Maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern, which he began to
      pull up in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in
      weeding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” exclaimed a voice from behind
      the trees. “Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a
      visitor in the drawing-room.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A visitor?” inquired Valentine, much agitated; “who is
      it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Some grand personage—a prince I believe they said—the
      Count of Monte Cristo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will come directly,” cried Valentine aloud. The name of
      Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other
      side of the iron gate, to whom Valentine’s <i>“I am coming”</i>
      was the customary signal of farewell. “Now, then,” said
      Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his spade, “I would give a good
      deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is
      acquainted with M. de Villefort.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 52. Toxicology
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was really the
      Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort’s
      for the purpose of returning the procureur’s visit, and at his name,
      as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in confusion. Madame de
      Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when the count was announced,
      desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his
      thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this great personage talked of
      for two whole days, made all possible haste to come to him, not from
      obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count,
      but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance remark might give him the
      opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his
      mother say,—“Oh, that naughty child! But I can’t be
      severe with him, he is really <i>so</i> bright.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort.
      “My husband dines with the chancellor,” replied the young
      lady; “he has just gone, and I am sure he’ll be exceedingly
      sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went.”
      Two visitors who were there when the count arrived, having gazed at him
      with all their eyes, retired after that reasonable delay which politeness
      admits and curiosity requires. “What is your sister Valentine doing?”
      inquired Madame de Villefort of Edward; “tell someone to bid her
      come here, that I may have the honor of introducing her to the count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have a daughter, then, madame?” inquired the count;
      “very young, I presume?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage,”
      replied the young wife, “a fine well-grown girl.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But melancholy,” interrupted Master Edward, snatching the
      feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its
      gilded perch, in order to make a plume for his hat. Madame de Villefort
      merely cried,—“Be still, Edward!” She then added,—“This
      young madcap is, however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes what he
      has heard me say with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de Villefort
      is, in spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy disposition
      and taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of her beauty. But
      what detains her? Go, Edward, and see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where are they looking for her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With grandpapa Noirtier.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you think she is not there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, no, no, no, she is not there,” replied Edward,
      singing his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And where is she, then? If you know, why don’t you tell?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is under the big chestnut-tree,” replied the spoiled
      brat, as he gave, in spite of his mother’s commands, live flies to
      the parrot, which seemed keenly to relish such fare. Madame de Villefort
      stretched out her hand to ring, intending to direct her waiting-maid to
      the spot where she would find Valentine, when the young lady herself
      entered the apartment. She appeared much dejected; and any person who
      considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears
      in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to
      our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful girl
      of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that reposeful
      air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother. Her white and
      slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with varying hues
      reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically
      compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan. She entered the
      apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had
      already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish awkwardness, or
      even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that redoubled the count’s
      attention. He rose to return the salutation. “Mademoiselle de
      Villefort, my step-daughter,” said Madame de Villefort to Monte
      Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards Valentine with her
      hand. “And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China, Emperor of
      Cochin-China,” said the young imp, looking slyly towards his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly
      angry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward; but
      the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy
      complacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, madame,” replied the count, continuing the conversation,
      and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, “have I
      not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before? I
      could not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and as
      mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light
      thrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not
      very fond of society, and we very seldom go out,” said the young
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or
      yourself, madame, or this charming little merry boy. Besides, the Parisian
      world is entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been
      in Paris but very few days. No,—but, perhaps, you will permit me to
      call to mind—stay!” The Count placed his hand on his brow as
      if to collect his thoughts. “No—it was somewhere—away
      from here—it was—I do not know—but it appears that this
      recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious <i>fête</i>;
      mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand, the interesting boy was
      chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you, madame, were under the
      trellis of some arbor. Pray come to my aid, madame; do not these
      circumstances appeal to your memory?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, indeed,” replied Madame de Villefort; “and yet it
      appears to me, sir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of
      you must have been imprinted on my memory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps the count saw us in Italy,” said Valentine timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably,” replied Monte
      Cristo; “you have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; madame and I were there two years ago. The doctors, anxious
      for my lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples. We went by Bologna,
      Perugia, and Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes—true, mademoiselle,” exclaimed Monte Cristo as
      if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he
      sought. “It was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of
      the Hôtel des Postes, when chance brought us together; you, Madame de
      Villefort, and her son; I now remember having had the honor of meeting
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the Hôtel des Postes,
      and the festival of which you speak,” said Madame de Villefort,
      “but in vain do I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed,
      for I really do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing
      you before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you,”
      observed Valentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I remember it perfectly,” interposed the darling Edward.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “I will assist your memory, madame,” continued the count;
      “the day had been burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which
      were delayed in consequence of the festival. Mademoiselle was walking in
      the shade of the garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the
      peacock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I caught it, mamma, don’t you remember?” interposed
      Edward, “and I pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that
      while you were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you,
      Mademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed
      for a considerable time with somebody?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, in truth, yes,” answered the young lady, turning very
      red, “I do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long
      woollen mantle; he was a medical man, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had
      been at that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of
      a fever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a
      reputation as a skilful physician. We discoursed a long time, madame, on
      different subjects; of Perugino, of Raphael, of manners, customs, of the
      famous <i>aqua Tofana</i>, of which they had told you, I think you said,
      that certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, true,” replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily,
      “I remember now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we
      discoursed, madame,” continued the count with perfect calmness;
      “but I perfectly remember that, falling into the error which others
      had entertained respecting me, you consulted me as to the health of
      Mademoiselle de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man,” said
      Madame de Villefort, “since you had cured the sick.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Molière or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was
      precisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself, I
      am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the natural
      sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you understand.”—At
      this moment the clock struck six. “It is six o’clock,”
      said Madame de Villefort, evidently agitated. “Valentine, will you
      not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner?” Valentine
      rose, and saluting the count, left the apartment without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, madame,” said the count, when Valentine had left the
      room, “was it on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort
      away?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By no means,” replied the young lady quickly; “but this
      is the hour when we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that
      sustains his pitiful existence. You are aware, sir, of the deplorable
      condition of my husband’s father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to me—a paralysis, I
      think.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind
      alone is still active in this human machine, and that is faint and
      flickering, like the light of a lamp about to expire. But excuse me, sir,
      for talking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the moment
      when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, madame, I did not say as much as that,” replied the count
      with a smile; “quite the contrary. I have studied chemistry because,
      having determined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of
      following the example of King Mithridates.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Mithridates, rex Ponticus</i>,” said the young scamp, as
      he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album, “the
      individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Edward, you naughty boy,” exclaimed Madame de Villefort,
      snatching the mutilated book from the urchin’s grasp, “you are
      positively past bearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave
      us, and join your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier’s
      room.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The album,” said Edward sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean?—the album!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I want the album.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How dare you tear out the drawings?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it amuses me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go—go at once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I won’t go unless you give me the album,” said the boy,
      seating himself doggedly in an armchair, according to his habit of never
      giving way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer,” said Madame de
      Villefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door, led
      by his mother. The count followed her with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us see if she shuts the door after him,” he muttered.
      Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child, the count
      appearing not to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance around the
      chamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she seated
      herself. “Allow me to observe, madame,” said the count, with
      that kind tone he could assume so well, “you are really very severe
      with that dear clever child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sometimes severity is quite necessary,” replied Madame de
      Villefort, with all a mother’s real firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he
      referred to King Mithridates,” continued the count, “and you
      interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means
      neglected him, for your son is really advanced for his years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact is, count,” answered the mother, agreeably
      flattered, “he has great aptitude, and learns all that is set before
      him. He has but one fault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring
      for the moment to what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used
      these precautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?”
    </p>

      “I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I
      might not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna—that is
      to say, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must
      have lost my life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And your precautions were successful?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Completely so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of
      this sort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?” said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably
      well counterfeited; “I really did not remember.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same
      effect, on men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me
      that the cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same
      aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the
      South.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that is the case,” observed Monte Cristo. “I have
      seen Russians devour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable
      substances which would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us
      than in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would
      habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive
      absorption of poison?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he
      should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not
      been accustomed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for
      instance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would
      be made use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance, brucine——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brucine is extracted from the false angostura [*] is it not?”
      inquired Madame de Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but I
      perceive I have not much to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your
      knowledge; such learning is very rare among ladies.”

      “Oh, I am aware of that,” said Madame de Villefort; “but
      I have a passion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination
      like poetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but
      go on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree.”

    <p>
      “Well,” replied Monte Cristo “suppose, then, that this
      poison was brucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two
      milligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days you
      would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days, increasing
      another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred centigrammes; that
      is to say, a dose which you would support without inconvenience, and which
      would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same
      precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the end of a month, when drinking
      water from the same carafe, you would kill the person who drank with you,
      without your perceiving, otherwise than from slight inconvenience, that
      there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know any other counter-poisons?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,”
      said Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, “and had always
      considered it a fable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell
      me, madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance query,
      for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said then, that for
      a very long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and
      mineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples
      frequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life of
      individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair, I
      have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a Flamel, a
      Fontana, or a Cabanis.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the more, madame,” said Monte Cristo, “as the
      Orientals do not confine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass
      of his poisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in
      their hands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an
      offensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings, the
      other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucea,
      snake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in
      their way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or Greek,
      whom here you call ‘good women,’ who do not know how, by means
      of chemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a confessor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really,” said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with
      strange fire at this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, indeed, madame,” continued Monte Cristo, “the
      secret dramas of the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death
      potion—begin with paradise and end with—hell. There are as
      many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the
      physical and moral nature of humanity; and I will say further—the
      art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate
      and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires
      for vengeance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, sir,” remarked the young woman, “these Eastern
      societies, in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your
      existence, are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange
      land. A man can easily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed,
      the Bagdad and Bassora of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>. The sultans
      and viziers who rule over society there, and who constitute what in France
      we call the government, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who
      not only pardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his
      crime has been an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have
      the whole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of
      idleness and <i>ennui</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East.
      There, disguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes,
      are police agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They
      hang, behead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible
      manner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape
      human justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning
      stratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or
      cupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose
      of, goes straight to the grocer’s or druggist’s, gives a false
      name, which leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and
      under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five
      or six grammes of arsenic—if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes
      to five or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only
      five or six times more easily traced;—then, when he has acquired his
      specific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of
      arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which, without
      rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire
      neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables. They fetch
      a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the entrails and
      stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a hundred newspapers
      relate the fact, with the names of the victim and the murderer. The same
      evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or druggists, come and say,
      ‘It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman;’ and rather
      than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they will recognize twenty. Then
      the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned, interrogated, confronted,
      confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or steel; or if she be a woman
      of any consideration, they lock her up for life. This is the way in which
      you Northerns understand chemistry, madame. Desrues was, however, I must
      confess, more skilful.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would you have, sir?” said the lady, laughing; “we
      do what we can. All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the
      Borgias.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, “shall
      I tell you the cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your
      theatres, by what at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play,
      they see persons swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a
      ring, and fall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls,
      and the spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the
      murder; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office,
      nor the corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools believe that the
      whole thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way from France—go
      either to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome, and you will see
      people passing by you in the streets—people erect, smiling, and
      fresh-colored, of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by the skirt of
      his mantle, would say, ‘That man was poisoned three weeks ago; he
      will be a dead man in a month.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “they have again
      discovered the secret of the famous <i>aqua Tofana</i> that they said was
      lost at Perugia.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change
      about and make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the
      vulgar do not follow them—that is all; but there is always the same
      result. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another—one on the
      stomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the poison
      brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or some other
      complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however, by no means
      precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were not, would be
      sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors, who
      are generally bad chemists, and which will act in favor of or against the
      malady, as you please; and then there is a human being killed according to
      all the rules of art and skill, and of whom justice learns nothing, as was
      said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance, the worthy Abbé Adelmonte
      of Taormina, in Sicily, who has studied these national phenomena very
      profoundly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,” said the
      young lady, motionless with attention. “I thought, I must confess,
      that these tales, were inventions of the Middle Ages.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,
      rewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead
      society towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect
      until he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and
      that is half the battle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So,” added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her
      object, “the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renées, the
      Ruggieris, and later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has
      been so misused by modern drama and romance——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were objects of art, madame, and nothing more,” replied the
      count. “Do you suppose that the real <i>savant</i> addresses himself
      stupidly to the mere individual? By no means. Science loves
      eccentricities, leaps and bounds, trials of strength, fancies, if I may be
      allowed so to term them. Thus, for instance, the excellent Abbé Adelmonte,
      of whom I spoke just now, made in this way some marvellous experiments.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden,
      full of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he
      selected the most simple—a cabbage, for instance. For three days he
      watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the
      cabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In the
      eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its wholesome
      appearance. It was only poisoned to the Abbé Adelmonte. He then took the
      cabbage to the room where he had rabbits—for the Abbé Adelmonte had
      a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as fine as his
      collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the Abbé Adelmonte
      took a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died.
      What magistrate would find, or even venture to insinuate, anything against
      this? What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against M.
      Magendie or M. Flourens, in consequence of the rabbits, cats, and
      guinea-pigs they have killed?—not one. So, then, the rabbit dies,
      and justice takes no notice. This rabbit dead, the Abbé Adelmonte has its
      entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill; on this
      dunghill is a hen, who, pecking these intestines, is in her turn taken
      ill, and dies next day. At the moment when she is struggling in the
      convulsions of death, a vulture is flying by (there are a good many
      vultures in Adelmonte’s country); this bird darts on the dead fowl,
      and carries it away to a rock, where it dines off its prey. Three days
      afterwards, this poor vulture, which has been very much indisposed since
      that dinner, suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds,
      and falls heavily into a fish-pond. The pike, eels, and carp eat greedily
      always, as everybody knows—well, they feast on the vulture. Now
      suppose that next day, one of these eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned at
      the fourth remove, is served up at your table. Well, then, your guest will
      be poisoned at the fifth remove, and die, at the end of eight or ten days,
      of pains in the intestines, sickness, or abscess of the pylorus. The
      doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning, ‘The
      subject has died of a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid fever!’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “all these
      circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the
      least accident; the vulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred
      yards from the fish-pond.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is where the art comes in. To be a great chemist in the
      East, one must direct chance; and this is to be achieved.”—Madame
      de Villefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively. “But,”
      she exclaimed, suddenly, “arsenic is indelible, indestructible; in
      whatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of the
      victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to
      cause death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely so,” cried Monte Cristo—“precisely so;
      and this is what I said to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and
      replied to me by a Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French
      proverb, ‘My son, the world was not made in a day—but in
      seven. Return on Sunday.’ On the Sunday following I did return to
      him. Instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic, he had watered it
      this time with a solution of salts, having their basis in strychnine, <i>strychnos
      colubrina</i>, as the learned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the
      slightest appearance of disease in the world, and the rabbit had not the
      smallest distrust; yet, five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The
      fowl pecked at the rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we
      were the vultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special
      symptoms had disappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no
      peculiar indication in any organ—an excitement of the nervous system—that
      was it; a case of cerebral congestion—nothing more. The fowl had not
      been poisoned—she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease
      among fowls, I believe, but very common among men.” Madame de
      Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very fortunate,” she observed, “that such
      substances could only be prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world
      would be poisoning each other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,” said
      Monte Cristo carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then,” said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a
      struggle, and with effort, to get away from her thoughts, “however
      skilfully it is prepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human
      scrutiny, it does not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger
      than we are in cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell—that
      is the point.”

      “Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a
      pure mind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.
      The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of
      Jean Jacques Rousseau,—you remember,—the mandarin who is
      killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man’s
      whole life passes in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by
      reflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and
      brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will
      administer to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on
      which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of which
      we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule—eccentric or
      stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to thirty-six
      degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings excited
      beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is permissible in
      philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym, then, instead of
      committing an ignoble assassination you make an ‘elimination;’
      you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your
      way, and that without shock or violence, without the display of the
      sufferings which, in the case of becoming a punishment, make a martyr of
      the victim, and a butcher, in every sense of the word, of him who inflicts
      them. Then there will be no blood, no groans, no convulsions, and above
      all, no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of
      accomplishing the act,—then one escapes the clutch of the human law,
      which says, ‘Do not disturb society!’ This is the mode in
      which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern climes, where there
      are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of
      time in conjunctures of importance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yet conscience remains,” remarked Madame de Villefort in an
      agitated voice, and with a stifled sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” answered Monte Cristo “happily, yes, conscience
      does remain; and if it did not, how wretched we should be! After every
      action requiring exertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies
      us with a thousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these
      reasons, howsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very
      little before a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives. Thus Richard
      III., for instance, was marvellously served by his conscience after the
      putting away of the two children of Edward IV.; in fact, he could say,
      ‘These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, who have
      inherited the vices of their father, which I alone could perceive in their
      juvenile propensities—these two children are impediments in my way
      of promoting the happiness of the English people, whose unhappiness they
      (the children) would infallibly have caused.’ Thus was Lady Macbeth
      served by her conscience, when she sought to give her son, and not her
      husband (whatever Shakespeare may say), a throne. Ah, maternal love is a
      great virtue, a powerful motive—so powerful that it excuses a
      multitude of things, even if, after Duncan’s death, Lady Macbeth had
      been at all pricked by her conscience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and
      horrible paradoxes, delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity
      which was peculiar to him. After a moment’s silence, the lady
      inquired, “Do you know, my dear count,” she said, “that
      you are a very terrible reasoner, and that you look at the world through a
      somewhat distempered medium? Have you really measured the world by
      scrutinies, or through alembics and crucibles? For you must indeed be a
      great chemist, and the elixir you administered to my son, which recalled
      him to life almost instantaneously——”

      “Oh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; <i>one</i> drop of
      that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops
      would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have
      produced most violent palpitations; six would have suspended his
      respiration, and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was;
      ten would have destroyed him. You know, madame, how suddenly I snatched
      him from those phials which he so imprudently touched?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it then so terrible a poison?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no. In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does

      which become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies.”

      “Oh,” observed Madame de Villefort, “it must be an
      admirable anti-spasmodic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perfect, madame, as you have seen,” replied the count;
      “and I frequently make use of it—with all possible prudence
      though, be it observed,” he added with a smile of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most assuredly,” responded Madame de Villefort in the same
      tone. “As for me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I
      should require a Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing
      freely and tranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine
      day of suffocation. In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in
      France, and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to Paris
      on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche’s
      anti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman’s drops are among my favorite
      remedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they are
      compounded doubly strong.” Monte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell
      box, which the lady presented to him, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges
      with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition.
      “They are indeed exquisite,” he said; “but as they are
      necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition—a function which
      it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish—I
      prefer my own specific.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have
      seen produced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as
      to ask it of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I,” said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke—“I
      am gallant enough to offer it you.”

    <p>
      “How kind you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only remember one thing—a small dose is a remedy, a large one
      is poison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will
      inevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured into a
      glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor. But
      I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were prescribing for you.”
      The clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of
      Madame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time,
      count, instead of only for the second,” said Madame de Villefort;
      “if I had had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having
      the happiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on
      detaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first
      refusal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand thanks, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “but I
      have an engagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the
      Académie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand
      opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour’s
      conversation I have had with you, which is indeed impossible.” Monte
      Cristo bowed, and left the house. Madame de Villefort remained immersed in
      thought. “He is a very strange man,” she said, “and in
      my opinion is himself the Adelmonte he talks about.” As to Monte
      Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations. “Good,”
      said he, as he went away; “this is a fruitful soil, and I feel
      certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground.” Next
      morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription requested.

      Chapter 53. Robert le Diable
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he pretext of an
      opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as there chanced to be on
      that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the Académie Royale.
      Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe illness, made his
      reappearance in the character of <i>Bertram</i>, and, as usual, the
      announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of
      the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience. Morcerf, like
      most other young men of rank and fortune, had his orchestra stall, with
      the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the
      principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance; he had, moreover,
      his right of entry into the omnibus box. Château-Renaud rented a stall
      beside his own, while Beauchamp, as a journalist, had unlimited range all
      over the theatre. It happened that on this particular night the minister’s
      box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray, who offered it to the
      Comte de Morcerf, who again, upon his mother’s rejection of it, sent
      it to Danglars, with an intimation that he should probably do himself the
      honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the
      event of their accepting the box in question. The ladies received the
      offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal. To no class of persons
      is the presentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the
      wealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a
      king’s ransom in his waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a ministerial
      box, declaring that his political principles, and his parliamentary
      position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to
      commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched a note to Lucien
      Debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly impossible for her to
      go alone with Eugénie to the opera. There is no gainsaying the fact that a
      very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if
      the two women had gone without escort, while the addition of a third, in
      the person of her mother’s admitted lover, enabled Mademoiselle
      Danglars to defy malice and ill-nature. One must take the world as one
      finds it.

    <p>
      The curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of the
      absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after
      the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is generally
      played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that part of the
      audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh
      arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting
      doors, and the buzz of conversation. “Surely,” said Albert, as
      the door of a box on the first circle opened, “that must be the
      Countess G——.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who is the Countess G——?” inquired
      Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to
      pick a quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know
      who the Countess G—— was.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, to be sure,” replied Château-Renaud; “the lovely
      Venetian, is it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Herself.” At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and
      returned his salutation with a smile. “You know her, it seems?”
      said Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Franz introduced me to her at Rome,” replied Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for
      you in Rome?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With pleasure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cry of “Shut up!” from the audience. This
      manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to
      hear the music, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men,
      who continued their conversation. “The countess was present at the
      races in the Champ-de-Mars,” said Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Today?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who was the winner?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nautilus. I staked on him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But there were three races, were there not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Club—a gold cup,
      you know—and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, shut up!” again interposed some of the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that possible?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by
      the name of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last
      moment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist,
      presented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff at
      least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider’s pockets, to
      make him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare,
      against whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey
      belonged?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly; that was the title.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” answered Albert, “I am better informed than you
      are, and know who the owner of that horse was.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shut up, there!” cried the pit in chorus. And this time the
      tone and manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing
      hostility that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the
      mandate was addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly
      scrutinized the various countenances around them, as though demanding
      someone person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they
      deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge,
      the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected to busy
      themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of the minister’s
      box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her daughter, entered,
      escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted them to their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ha, ha,” said Château-Renaud, “here come some friends
      of yours, viscount! What are you looking at there? don’t you see
      they are trying to catch your eye?” Albert turned round, just in
      time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for
      Mademoiselle Eugénie, she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her
      large black eyes even upon the business of the stage. “I tell you
      what, my dear fellow,” said Château-Renaud, “I cannot imagine
      what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle Danglars—that
      is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank, which
      by the way I don’t think you care very much about. Now, barring all
      that, I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Handsome, certainly,” replied Albert, “but not to my
      taste, which I confess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more
      feminine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, well,” exclaimed Château-Renaud, who because he had seen
      his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of
      paternal air with his more youthful friend, “you young people are
      never satisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen
      you a bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not
      content.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked
      something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this
      chase-loving Diana, continually surrounded by her nymphs, gives me a sort
      of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Actæon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to
      comprehend the justness of Morcerf’s remark—she was beautiful,
      but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a
      fastidious taste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed
      somewhat rebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were
      surmounted by well-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in
      an almost habitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression
      of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler
      attributes of her sex—her nose was precisely what a sculptor would
      have chosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found
      fault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered
      still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips, contrasting
      vividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which completed the
      almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste, was a dark
      mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are,
      placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended to increase
      the expression of self-dependence that characterized her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of Mademoiselle Eugénie’s person was in perfect keeping
      with the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of Diana, as
      Château-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute. As
      regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with them was the
      same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty, that
      they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person. She
      was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote poetry, and composed
      music; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted,
      following it with an indefatigable perseverance, assisted by a
      schoolfellow,—a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to
      develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored that she was an
      object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of
      the day, who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her
      voice, which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence.
      But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit
      herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life;
      and acting upon this principle, the banker’s daughter, though
      perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly (that was
      the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with her through the day, took
      especial care not to be seen in her company. Still, though not actually
      received at the Hôtel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend,
      Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is
      usually bestowed on a governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame Danglars
      into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half-hour’s
      interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were left at liberty
      to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive visits in their
      respective boxes. Morcerf and Château-Renaud were amongst the first to
      avail themselves of this permission. For an instant the idea struck Madame
      Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from
      his impatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to
      her daughter, that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them.
      Mademoiselle Eugénie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of
      the head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her
      mother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the Countess G——,
      and where Morcerf had just made his appearance. “So we meet again,
      my travelling friend, do we?” cried the countess, extending her hand
      to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance; “it
      was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly, and still more so
      to bestow your first visit on me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be assured,” replied Albert, “that if I had been aware
      of your arrival in Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid
      my respects to you before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de
      Château-Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France,
      and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races
      in the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday.” Château-Renaud bowed to the
      countess.

    <p>
      “So you were at the races, baron?” inquired the countess
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, madame.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” pursued Madame G—— with considerable
      animation, “you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sorry to say I cannot,” replied the baron; “and I
      was just asking the same question of Albert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you very anxious to know, countess?” asked Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To know what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The name of the owner of the winning horse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excessively; only imagine—but do tell me, viscount, whether
      you really are acquainted with it or no?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story,
      were you not? You said, ‘only imagine,’—and then paused.
      Pray continue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the
      splendid roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed
      in a pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their
      success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at
      stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the
      winning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with joy.
      Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object I met on
      the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I concluded
      that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse must live in
      the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments, I beheld the
      very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider. Inside
      the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written these words—‘From
      Lord Ruthven to Countess G——.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely; I was sure of it,” said Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sure of what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What Lord Ruthven do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, our Lord Ruthven—the Vampire of the Salle Argentina!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible?” exclaimed the countess; “is he here in
      Paris?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be sure,—why not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you visit him?—meet him at your own house and elsewhere?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de
      Château-Renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club
      prize?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom
      I was made prisoner?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a
      manner?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be sure, I remember it all now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He called himself Vampa. You see, it’s evident where the
      count got the name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you
      may believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman
      take so lively an interest in his success.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish
      remarks we used to make about him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his
      presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful
      grudge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does his action appear like that of an enemy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; certainly not.”

    <p>
      “And so he is in Paris?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what effect does he produce?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” said Albert, “he was talked about for a week;
      then the coronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the
      theft of Mademoiselle Mars’s diamonds; and so people talked of
      something else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good fellow,” said Château-Renaud, “the count is
      your friend and you treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is
      telling you, countess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian
      circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I
      take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first
      astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses,
      worth 32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous
      preservation of Madame de Villefort’s life; now it seems that he has
      carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain, in
      spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest at
      this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a month
      longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which, after
      all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps you are right,” said Morcerf; “meanwhile, who
      is in the Russian ambassador’s box?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which box do you mean?” asked the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The one between the pillars on the first tier—it seems to
      have been fitted up entirely afresh.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you observe anyone during the first act?” asked
      Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that box.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the countess, “it was certainly empty
      during the first act;” then, resuming the subject of their previous
      conversation, she said, “And so you really believe it was your
      mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sure of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who afterwards sent the cup to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I don’t know him,” said the countess; “I have
      a great mind to return it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another,
      formed of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It
      is his way, and you must take him as you find him.” At this moment
      the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second
      act. Albert rose to return to his place. “Shall I see you again?”
      asked the countess. “At the end of the next act, with your
      permission, I will come and inquire whether there is anything I can do for
      you in Paris?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray take notice,” said the countess, “that my present
      residence is 22 Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every
      Saturday evening. So now, you are both forewarned.” The young men
      bowed, and quitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls, they found the
      whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze
      towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador. A man of
      from thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in deep black, had just
      entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style. The
      lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the rich magnificence of her attire
      drew all eyes upon her. “Hullo,” said Albert; “it is
      Monte Cristo and his Greek!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Haydée. In a few
      moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house, and
      even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her
      magnificent diamonds. The second act passed away during one continued buzz
      of voices—one deep whisper—intimating that some great and
      universally interesting event had occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were
      occupied with the young and beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and
      splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle. Upon this occasion an
      unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see Albert
      in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act, and neither the
      politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his neglecting an
      invitation so unequivocally given. At the close of the act he therefore
      went to the baroness. Having bowed to the two ladies, he extended his hand
      to Debray. By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed, while Eugénie
      received him with her accustomed coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow,” said Debray, “you have come in the
      nick of time. There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting
      the count; she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education,
      and parentage, where he came from, and whither he is going. Being no
      disciple of Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of
      getting out of the scrape, I said, ‘Ask Morcerf; he has got the
      whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers’ ends;’
      whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it not almost incredible,” said Madame Danglars, “that
      a person having at least half a million of secret-service money at his
      command, should possess so little information?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me assure you, madame,” said Lucien, “that had I
      really the sum you mention at my disposal, I would employ it more
      profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the
      Count of Monte Cristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being
      twice as rich as a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to
      Morcerf, so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for
      my own part, I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.”

    <p>
      “I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth
      32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs
      each.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He seems to have a mania for diamonds,” said Morcerf,
      smiling, “and I verily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his
      pockets filled, for the sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb
      did his flint stones.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps he has discovered some mine,” said Madame Danglars.
      “I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the
      baron’s banking establishment?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was not aware of it,” replied Albert, “but I can
      readily believe it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only
      staying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six
      millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling <i>incog</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M.
      Lucien?” inquired Eugénie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the
      charms of another as yourself,” responded Lucien, raising his
      lorgnette to his eye. “A most lovely creature, upon my soul!”
      was his verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?” inquired Eugénie;
      “does anybody know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle,” said Albert, replying to this direct appeal,
      “I can give you very exact information on that subject, as well as
      on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now
      conversing—the young woman is a Greek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that,
      everyone here is as well-informed as yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a <i>cicerone</i>,”
      replied Morcerf, “but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have
      nothing further to communicate—yes, stay, I do know one thing more,
      namely, that she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be
      breakfasting with the count, I heard the sound of a guzla—it is
      impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her
      own.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then your count entertains visitors, does he?” asked Madame
      Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or
      dinner, or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in
      return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What,” said Debray, laughing; “do you really mean you
      would go to his house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not? my husband could accompany me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,”
      said the baroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no!” exclaimed Debray; “that girl is not his wife:
      he told us himself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his
      telling us so at your breakfast?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” said the baroness, “if slave she be, she
      has all the air and manner of a princess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of the ‘Arabian Nights’?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that
      constitutes a princess. Why, diamonds—and she is covered with them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me she seems overloaded,” observed Eugénie; “she
      would look far better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see
      her finely formed throat and wrists.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “See how the artist peeps out!” exclaimed Madame Danglars.
      “My poor Eugénie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I admire all that is beautiful,” returned the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you think of the count?” inquired Debray; “he
      is not much amiss, according to my ideas of good looks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count,” repeated Eugénie, as though it had not occurred
      to her to observe him sooner; “the count?—oh, he is so
      dreadfully pale.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I quite agree with you,” said Morcerf; “and the secret
      of that very pallor is what we want to find out. The Countess G——
      insists upon it that he is a vampire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then the Countess G—— has returned to Paris, has she?”
      inquired the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that she, mamma?” asked Eugénie; “almost opposite to
      us, with that profusion of beautiful light hair?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Madame Danglars, “that is she. Shall I tell
      you what you ought to do, Morcerf?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Command me, madame.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to
      us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What for?” asked Eugénie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no
      desire to meet him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None whatever,” replied Eugénie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Strange child,” murmured the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He will very probably come of his own accord,” said Morcerf.
      “There; do you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows.” The
      baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Morcerf, “I may as well be magnanimous, and
      tear myself away to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there
      are any means of speaking to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I have never been presented.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Presented to whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the beautiful Greek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You say she is only a slave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “While you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I
      hope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is possible—go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am going,” said Albert, as he made his parting bow. Just as
      he was passing the count’s box, the door opened, and Monte Cristo
      came forth. After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in the lobby,
      the count took Albert’s arm. Carefully closing the box door, Ali
      placed himself before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round the
      Nubian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my word,” said Monte Cristo, “Paris is a strange
      city, and the Parisians a very singular people. See that cluster of
      persons collected around poor Ali, who is as much astonished as
      themselves; really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever
      beheld. Now I can promise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in
      public, either in Tunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being
      treated in that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to
      waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However,
      as far as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is
      merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant—you, who
      are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really? and what has procured me so fluttering a distinction?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a
      thousand louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty;
      under the name of Major Black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins
      not larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy
      of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first
      handsome woman you think of!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by
      the by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by
      others; secondly, I learned it from Beauchamp’s journal; and
      thirdly, from my own imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you
      call your horse Vampa?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That was an oversight, certainly,” replied the count; “but
      tell me, does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been
      looking for him, but without success.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He will be here tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what part of the house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the baroness’s box, I believe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That charming young woman with her is her daughter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I congratulate you.” Morcerf smiled. “We will discuss
      that subject at length some future time,” said he. “But what
      do you think of the music?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What music?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, the music you have been listening to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung
      by featherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes.”

      “From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure
      enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more
      exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I go
      to sleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what
      else was opera invented for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the
      manner I speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a
      certain preparation——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know—the famous hashish!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled
      with music come and sup with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you,”
      said Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you mean at Rome?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, then, I suppose you heard Haydée’s guzla; the poor exile
      frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her
      native land.” Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo
      himself fell into a silent reverie. The bell rang at this moment for the
      rising of the curtain. “You will excuse my leaving you,” said
      the count, turning in the direction of his box.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? Are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G—— on
      the part of her friend the vampire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what message shall I convey to the baroness!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my
      respects in the course of the evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf,
      according to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame
      Danglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest
      or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence, therefore, was
      wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in which he had just
      seated himself. The quick eye of Monte Cristo however, marked his coming;
      and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips. Haydée, whose soul
      seemed centred in the business of the stage, like all unsophisticated
      natures, delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julie, and
      Leroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the
      Prince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella, taking
      his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic strides, the
      better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle. After
      which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured forth from the
      theatre into the lobbies and salon. The count left his box, and a moment
      later was saluting the Baronne Danglars, who could not restrain a cry of
      mingled pleasure and surprise. “You are welcome, count!” she
      exclaimed, as he entered. “I have been most anxious to see you, that
      I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your
      remembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day
      after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame de
      Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity
      restored to me.”

      “Was it Ali,” asked the Count of Morcerf, “who rescued
      my son from the hands of bandits?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, count,” replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to
      him by the general; “in this instance I may fairly and freely accept
      your thanks; but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your
      debt—if indeed there existed one—and I feel almost mortified
      to find you still reverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to
      honor me with an introduction to your daughter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you are no stranger—at least not by name,” replied
      Madame Danglars, “and the last two or three days we have really
      talked of nothing but you. Eugénie,” continued the baroness, turning
      towards her daughter, “this is the Count of Monte Cristo.” The
      Count bowed, while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly. “You
      have a charming young person with you tonight, count,” said Eugénie.
      “Is she your daughter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, mademoiselle,” said Monte Cristo, astonished at the
      coolness and freedom of the question. “She is a poor unfortunate
      Greek left under my care.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is her name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Haydée,” replied Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Greek?” murmured the Count of Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, indeed, count,” said Madame Danglars; “and tell
      me, did you ever see at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously
      and valiantly served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did I hear rightly, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo “that
      you served at Yanina?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was inspector-general of the pasha’s troops,” replied
      Morcerf; “and it is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is,
      to the liberality of the illustrious Albanese chief.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But look!” exclaimed Madame Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?” stammered Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There,” said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count,
      and leaning with him over the front of the box, just as Haydée, whose eyes
      were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian,
      perceived his pale features close to Morcerf’s face. It was as if
      the young girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to
      assure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint cry,
      threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people about
      Ali, who instantly opened the box-door. “Why, count,”
      exclaimed Eugénie, “what has happened to your ward? she seems to
      have been taken suddenly ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very probably,” answered the count. “But do not be
      alarmed on her account. Haydée’s nervous system is delicately
      organized, and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers—nay,
      there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence.
      However,” continued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his
      pocket, “I have an infallible remedy.” So saying, he bowed to
      the baroness and her daughter, exchanged a parting shake of the hand with
      Debray and the count, and left Madame Danglars’ box. Upon his return
      to Haydée he found her still very pale. As soon as she saw him she seized
      his hand; her own hands were moist and icy cold. “Who was it you
      were talking with over there?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With the Count of Morcerf,” answered Monte Cristo. “He
      tells me he served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune
      to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wretch!” exclaimed Haydée, her eyes flashing with rage;
      “he sold my father to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was
      the price of his treachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Something of this I heard in Epirus,” said Monte Cristo;
      “but the particulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them
      to me, my child. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to
      remain long near that dreadful man.” So saying, Haydée arose, and
      wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls
      and coral, she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was
      rising upon the fourth act.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you observe,” said the Countess G—— to Albert,
      who had returned to her side, “that man does nothing like other
      people; he listens most devoutly to the third act of <i>Robert le Diable</i>,
      and when the fourth begins, takes his departure.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 54. A Flurry in Stocks
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome days after
      this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of Monte Cristo at his
      house in the Champs-Élysées, which had already assumed that palace-like
      appearance which the count’s princely fortune enabled him to give
      even to his most temporary residences. He came to renew the thanks of
      Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the
      medium of a letter, signed “Baronne Danglars, <i>née</i> Hermine de
      Servieux.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who, joining in his friend’s
      conversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the
      count’s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess. He was
      convinced that Lucien’s visit was due to a double feeling of
      curiosity, the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la
      Chaussée d’Antin. In short, Madame Danglars, not being able
      personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household
      arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who
      went to the opera with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a
      million of money, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed to
      see, to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this
      incomprehensible person. But the count did not appear to suspect that
      there could be the slightest connection between Lucien’s visit and
      the curiosity of the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?”
      the count inquired of Albert de Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, count, you know what I told you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All remains the same, then, in that quarter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is more than ever a settled thing,” said Lucien,—and,
      considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon
      to make, he adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold
      headed cane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms
      and the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Monte Cristo “I did not expect that the
      affair would be so promptly concluded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, things take their course without our assistance. While we are
      forgetting them, they are falling into their appointed order; and when,
      again, our attention is directed to them, we are surprised at the progress
      they have made towards the proposed end. My father and M. Danglars served
      together in Spain, my father in the army and M. Danglars in the
      commissariat department. It was there that my father, ruined by the
      revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any patrimony, both
      laid the foundations of their different fortunes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Monte Cristo “I think M. Danglars mentioned
      that in a visit which I paid him; and,” continued he, casting a
      side-glance at Lucien, who was turning over the leaves of an album,
      “Mademoiselle Eugénie is pretty—I think I remember that to be
      her name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful,” replied Albert,
      “but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an
      ungrateful fellow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You speak as if you were already her husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what
      Lucien was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really,” said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, “you do
      not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,” replied Morcerf,
      “and that frightens me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “that’s a fine
      reason to give. Are you not rich yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father’s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he
      will give me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris
      especially,” said the count; “but everything does not depend
      on wealth, and it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a
      high station in society. Your name is celebrated, your position
      magnificent; and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is
      pleasing to see the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a
      Duguesclin; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword
      can shine. As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a
      most suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.”
      Albert shook his head, and looked thoughtful. “There is still
      something else,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I confess,” observed Monte Cristo, “that I have some
      difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both
      rich and beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Morcerf, “this repugnance, if repugnance it
      may be called, is not all on my side.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whence can it arise, then? for you told me your father desired the
      marriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating
      judgment, and does not smile on the proposed union. I cannot account for
      it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, “that
      may be easily explained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and
      refinement itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your
      marriage with one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know if that is her reason,” said Albert, “but
      one thing I do know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render
      her quite miserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in
      order to talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack
      of indisposition——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Real?” interrupted the count, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,—at any rate they
      postponed the matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not
      yet twenty-one, and Eugénie is only seventeen; but the two months expire
      next week. It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my mind
      is harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from
      being so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not
      marry Mademoiselle Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Marry her then,” said the count, with a significant shrug of
      the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Morcerf, “but that will plunge my mother
      into positive grief.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then do not marry her,” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I shall see. I will try and think over what is the best thing
      to be done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible
      extricate me from my unpleasant position? I think, rather than give pain
      to my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count.”
      Monte Cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark. “Ah,”
      said he to Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at the
      farthest extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right hand
      and an account book in his left, “what are you doing there? Are you
      making a sketch after Poussin?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” was the tranquil response; “I am too fond of
      art to attempt anything of that sort. I am doing a little sum in
      arithmetic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In arithmetic?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I am calculating—by the way, Morcerf, that indirectly
      concerns you—I am calculating what the house of Danglars must have
      gained by the last rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in
      three days, and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must
      have made 300,000 livres.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not his biggest scoop,” said Morcerf; “did he
      not make a million in Spaniards this last year?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow,” said Lucien, “here is the Count of
      Monte Cristo, who will say to you, as the Italians do,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Denaro e santità, Metà della metà.’ [*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * “Money and sanctity, Each in a moiety.
</pre>
    <p>
      “When they tell me such things, I only shrug my shoulders and say
      nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you were speaking of Haitians?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, Haitians,—that is quite another thing! Haitians are the
      <i>écarté</i> of French stock-jobbing. We may like bouillotte, delight in
      whist, be enraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we
      always come back to <i>écarté</i>—it is not only a game, it is a <i>hors-d’œuvre</i>!
      M. Danglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs. Had he but
      waited till today, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of
      gaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?” asked
      Monte Cristo. “I am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing
      intrigues.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because,” said Albert, laughing, “one piece of news
      follows another, and there is often great dissimilarity between them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the count, “I see that M. Danglars is
      accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must
      be enormously rich.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not he who plays!” exclaimed Lucien; “it is
      Madame Danglars; she is indeed daring.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you who are a reasonable being, Lucien, and who knows how
      little dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the
      fountain-head, surely you ought to prevent it,” said Morcerf, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?” asked
      Lucien; “you know the character of the baroness—no one has any
      influence with her, and she does precisely what she pleases.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, if I were in your place——” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future
      son-in-law.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How would you set about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that would be easy enough—I would give her a lesson.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A lesson?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. Your position as secretary to the minister renders your
      authority great on the subject of political news; you never open your
      mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words. Cause her to
      lose a hundred thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand,” stammered Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very clear, notwithstanding,” replied the young man,
      with an artlessness wholly free from affectation; “tell her some
      fine morning an unheard-of piece of intelligence—some telegraphic
      despatch, of which you alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri
      IV. was seen yesterday at Gabrielle’s. That would boom the market;
      she will buy heavily, and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces
      the following day, in his gazette, ‘The report circulated by some
      usually well-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at
      Gabrielle’s house, is totally without foundation. We can positively
      assert that his majesty did not quit the Pont-Neuf.’” Lucien
      half smiled. Monte Cristo, although apparently indifferent, had not lost
      one word of this conversation, and his penetrating eye had even read a
      hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary. This
      embarrassment had completely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien to
      shorten his visit; he was evidently ill at ease. The count, in taking
      leave of him, said something in a low voice, to which he answered, “Willingly,
      count; I accept.” The count returned to young Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you not think, on reflection,” said he to him, “that
      you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence
      of M. Debray?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear count,” said Morcerf, “I beg of you not to
      apply that title so prematurely.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so
      very much averse to this marriage?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my
      mother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said the count, “I am emboldened to speak openly
      to you. M. Danglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with
      politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune
      enabled me to render him. I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners
      and routs. Now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be beforehand
      with them, I have, if agreeable to you, thought of inviting M. and Madame
      Danglars, and M. and Madame de Villefort, to my country-house at Auteuil.
      If I were to invite you and the Count and Countess of Morcerf to this
      dinner, I should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting, or
      at least Madame de Morcerf would look upon the affair in that light,
      especially if Baron Danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter. In
      that case your mother would hold me in aversion, and I do not at all wish
      that; on the contrary, I desire to stand high in her esteem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, count,” said Morcerf, “I thank you sincerely
      for having used so much candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the
      exclusion which you propose. You say you desire my mother’s good
      opinion; I assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Do you think so?” said Monte Cristo, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the
      other day. But to return to what we were saying. If my mother could know
      of this attention on your part—and I will venture to tell her—I
      am sure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father
      will be equally angry.” The count laughed. “Well,” said
      he to Morcerf, “but I think your father will not be the only angry
      one; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very ill-mannered person. They
      know that I am intimate with you—that you are, in fact; one of the
      oldest of my Parisian acquaintances—and they will not find you at my
      house; they will certainly ask me why I did not invite you. Be sure to
      provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a
      semblance of probability, and communicate the fact to me by a line in
      writing. You know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be
      valid.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do better than that,” said Albert; “my mother is
      wishing to go to the sea-side—what day is fixed for your dinner?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Saturday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is Tuesday—well, tomorrow evening we leave, and the day
      after we shall be at Tréport. Really, count, you have a delightful way of
      setting people at their ease.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, you give me more credit than I deserve; I only wish to do
      what will be agreeable to you, that is all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When shall you send your invitations?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This very day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I will immediately call on M. Danglars, and tell him that my
      mother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow. I have not seen you,
      consequently I know nothing of your dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How foolish you are! Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just
      seen you at my house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fix it this way. I have seen you, and invited you without any
      ceremony, when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you
      to accept, as you were going to Tréport.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, that is settled; but you will come and call on my
      mother before tomorrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before tomorrow?—that will be a difficult matter to arrange,
      besides, I shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you can do better. You were only a charming man before, but,
      if you accede to my proposal, you will be adorable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What must I do to attain such sublimity?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are today free as air—come and dine with me; we shall be
      a small party—only yourself, my mother, and I. You have scarcely
      seen my mother; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more
      closely. She is a remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not
      exist another like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure
      you, there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf. As to
      my father, you will not see him; he is officially engaged, and dines with
      the chief referendary. We will talk over our travels; and you, who have
      seen the whole world, will relate your adventures—you shall tell us
      the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night at the
      Opera, and whom you call your slave, and yet treat like a princess. We
      will talk Italian and Spanish. Come, accept my invitation, and my mother
      will thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand thanks,” said the count, “your invitation is
      most gracious, and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to
      accept it. I am not so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I
      have a most important engagement.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an
      invitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse. I require the
      proof of a pre-engagement. I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but I am
      quite as incredulous as he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am going to give you a proof,” replied the count, and he
      rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Humph,” said Morcerf, “this is the second time you have
      refused to dine with my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her.”
      Monte Cristo started. “Oh, you do not mean that,” said he;
      “besides, here comes the confirmation of my assertion.”
      Baptistin entered, and remained standing at the door. “I had no
      previous knowledge of your visit, had I?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not
      answer for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At all events, I could not guess that you would invite me to
      dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Probably not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I
      called you into my laboratory?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck
      five,” replied the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my dear count,” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you
      have given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting
      Manfred. I wish my life to be free and open. Go on, Baptistin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his
      son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You hear—Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti—a man who ranks
      amongst the most ancient nobility of Italy, whose name Dante has
      celebrated in the tenth canto of <i>The Inferno</i>, you remember it, do
      you not? Then there is his son, Andrea, a charming young man, about your
      own age, viscount, bearing the same title as yourself, and who is making
      his entry into the Parisian world, aided by his father’s millions.
      The major will bring his son with him this evening, the <i>contino</i>, as
      we say in Italy; he confides him to my care. If he proves himself worthy
      of it, I will do what I can to advance his interests. You will assist me
      in the work, will you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most undoubtedly. This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,
      then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By no means. He is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and
      agreeable, such as may be found constantly in Italy, descendants of very
      ancient families. I have met him several times at Florence, Bologna and
      Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in Paris.
      The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one;
      they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid
      them by chance, as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to
      awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may
      happen to be thrown in the course of your journey. This good Major
      Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris, which he only saw in
      passing through in the time of the Empire, when he was on his way to
      Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he will confide his son to my
      care, I will promise to watch over him, I shall let him follow in whatever
      path his folly may lead him, and then I shall have done my part.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; I see you are a model Mentor,” said Albert “Good-bye,
      we shall return on Sunday. By the way, I have received news of Franz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you? Is he still amusing himself in Italy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe so; however, he regrets your absence extremely. He says
      you were the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and
      cloudy; I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it
      rains.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His opinion of me is altered for the better, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, he still persists in looking upon you as the most
      incomprehensible and mysterious of beings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a charming young man,” said Monte Cristo “and I
      felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction,
      when I met him in search of a supper, and prevailed upon him to accept a
      portion of mine. He is, I think, the son of General d’Epinay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the Bonapartists.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. Really I like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial
      engagement contemplated for him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?”

      “And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars,” said
      Albert, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You smile.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you do so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination
      for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own.
      But really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they do of
      us; it is unpardonable.” Albert rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, that is a good idea!—two hours have I been boring you
      to death with my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask
      me if I am going. Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the
      world. And your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is
      quite a style about them. Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get
      such a man as that. My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in
      a play, who, because they have only a word or two to say, aquit themselves
      in the most awkward manner possible. Therefore, if you part with M.
      Baptistin, give me the refusal of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By all means.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese,
      Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing to
      establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her mother’s
      side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will help you in
      the search.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, really, nothing is certain in this world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, count, what a service you might render me! I should like you a
      hundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain a
      bachelor, even were it only for ten years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing is impossible,” gravely replied Monte Cristo; and
      taking leave of Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong
      three times. Bertuccio appeared. “Monsieur Bertuccio, you understand
      that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteuil.”
      Bertuccio slightly started. “I shall require your services to see
      that all be properly arranged. It is a beautiful house, or at all events
      may be made so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title,
      your excellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of
      the sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask; you will leave that
      exactly as it is.” Bertuccio bowed. “You will not touch the
      garden either; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I
      should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your
      excellency. I should be glad, however, to receive your excellency’s
      commands concerning the dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, my dear M. Bertuccio,” said the count, “since
      you have been in Paris, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out
      of your element; you no longer seem to understand me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you
      are expecting to receive?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should
      do so. ‘Lucullus dines with Lucullus,’ that is quite
      sufficient.” Bertuccio bowed, and left the room.

      Chapter 55. Major Cavalcanti
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>oth the count and
      Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed
      visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for
      declining Albert’s invitation. Seven o’clock had just struck,
      and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given him, had
      two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the door, and
      after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately hurried away, as if
      ashamed of its employment. The visitor was about fifty-two years of age,
      dressed in one of the green surtouts, ornamented with black frogs, which
      have so long maintained their popularity all over Europe. He wore trousers
      of blue cloth, boots tolerably clean, but not of the brightest polish, and
      a little too thick in the soles, buckskin gloves, a hat somewhat
      resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes, and a black
      cravat striped with white, which, if the proprietor had not worn it of his
      own free will, might have passed for a halter, so much did it resemble
      one. Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate,
      and demanded if it was not at No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées that
      the Count of Monte Cristo lived, and who, being answered by the porter in
      the affirmative, entered, closed the gate after him, and began to ascend
      the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray
      moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had
      received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was
      awaiting him in the hall. Therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to
      pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. He was
      ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to meet
      him with a smiling air. “Ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I
      was expecting you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed,” said the Italian, “was your excellency then
      aware of my visit?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I had been told that I should see you today at seven o’clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you have received full information concerning my arrival?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, so much the better, I feared this little precaution might have
      been forgotten.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What precaution?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That of informing you beforehand of my coming.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, it has not.”

    <p>
      “But you are sure you are not mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o’clock
      this evening?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will prove it to you beyond a doubt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, never mind that,” said the Italian; “it is not
      worth the trouble.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes,” said Monte Cristo. His visitor appeared slightly
      uneasy. “Let me see,” said the count; “are you not the
      Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bartolomeo Cavalcanti,” joyfully replied the Italian; “yes,
      I am really he.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ex-major in the Austrian service?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was I a major?” timidly asked the old soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Monte Cristo “you were a major; that is the
      title the French give to the post which you filled in Italy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good,” said the major, “I do not demand more, you
      understand——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion, is it?”
      said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, certainly not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were sent by some other person?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the excellent Abbé Busoni?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly so,” said the delighted major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you have a letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, there it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Give it to me, then;” and Monte Cristo took the letter, which
      he opened and read. The major looked at the count with his large staring
      eyes, and then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost
      immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, I see. ‘Major Cavalcanti, a worthy patrician of
      Lucca, a descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence,’” continued
      Monte Cristo, reading aloud, “‘possessing an income of half a
      million.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper, and bowed. “Half a
      million,” said he, “magnificent!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Half a million, is it?” said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbé knows
      correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea
      that it was so much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because you are robbed by your steward. You must make some
      reformation in that quarter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have opened my eyes,” said the Italian gravely; “I
      will show the gentlemen the door.” Monte Cristo resumed the perusal
      of the letter:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, indeed but one!” said the major with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Which is to recover a lost and adored son.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A lost and adored son!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble
      family or by the gypsies.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the age of five years!” said the major with a deep sigh,
      and raising his eye to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unhappy father,” said Monte Cristo. The count continued:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘I have given him renewed life and hope, in the assurance
      that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for
      fifteen years.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have the power of so doing,” said Monte Cristo. The major
      recovered his self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, then,” said he, “the letter was true to the end?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious
      office, as does the Abbé Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play
      off a joke; but your excellency has not read all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true,” said Monte Cristo “there is a postscript.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes,” repeated the major, “yes—there—is—a—postscript.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on
      his banker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling
      expenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which
      you still owe me.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript, apparently with great
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good,” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He said ‘very good,’” muttered the major, “then—sir——”
      replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what?” asked Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then the postscript——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well; what of the postscript?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of
      the letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; the Abbé Busoni and myself have a small account open
      between us. I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000 francs, which I am
      still owing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference. You
      attached great importance, then, to this postscript, my dear Monsieur
      Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must explain to you,” said the major, “that, fully
      confiding in the signature of the Abbé Busoni, I had not provided myself
      with any other funds; so that if this resource had failed me, I should
      have found myself very unpleasantly situated in Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed
      anywhere?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, really I know no one,” said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But then you yourself are known to others?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I am known, so that——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Proceed, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, at your first request.” The major’s eyes
      dilated with pleasing astonishment. “But sit down,” said Monte
      Cristo; “really I do not know what I have been thinking of—I
      have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t mention it.” The major drew an armchair towards
      him, and proceeded to seat himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said the count, “what will you take—a glass
      of sherry, port, or Alicante?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have some that is very good. You will take a biscuit with it,
      will you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared. The count advanced to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?” said he in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The young man is here,” said the valet de chambre in the same
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Into what room did you take him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency’s
      orders.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptistin left the room. “Really,” said the major, “I am
      quite ashamed of the trouble I am giving you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray don’t mention such a thing,” said the count.
      Baptistin re-entered with glasses, wine, and biscuits. The count filled
      one glass, but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored
      liquid. The bottle was covered with spiders’ webs, and all the other
      signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man’s
      face. The major made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit.
      The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who
      began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction,
      and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you? You were rich, noble, held in
      great esteem—had all that could render a man happy?”

    <p>
      “All,” said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, “positively
      all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your
      happiness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only one thing,” said the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that one thing, your lost child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the major, taking a second biscuit, “that
      consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting.” The worthy major
      raised his eyes to heaven and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me hear, then,” said the count, “who this deeply
      regretted son was; for I always understood you were a bachelor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That was the general opinion, sir,” said the major, “and
      I——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the count, “and you confirmed the report.
      A youthful indiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from
      the world at large?” The major recovered himself, and resumed his
      usual calm manner, at the same time casting his eyes down, either to give
      himself time to compose his countenance, or to assist his imagination, all
      the while giving an under-look at the count, the protracted smile on whose
      lips still announced the same polite curiosity. “Yes,” said
      the major, “I did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not on your own account, surely,” replied Monte Cristo;
      “for a man is above that sort of thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, certainly not on my own account,” said the major with
      a smile and a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But for the sake of the mother?” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, for the mother’s sake—his poor mother!”
      cried the major, taking a third biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti,” said the count,
      pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante; “your emotion has
      quite overcome you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His poor mother,” murmured the major, trying to get the
      lachrymal gland in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with
      a false tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did
      she not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She was of a noble family of Fiesole, count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And her name was——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you desire to know her name——?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Monte Cristo “it would be quite superfluous
      for you to tell me, for I already know it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count knows everything,” said the Italian, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oliva Corsinari, was it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oliva Corsinari!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A marchioness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A marchioness!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her
      family?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, that was the way it ended.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?”
      said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What papers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the
      register of your child’s birth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The register of my child’s birth?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti—of your son;
      is not his name Andrea?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe so,” said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? You believe so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a
      time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” said Monte Cristo “you have all the
      documents with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary
      to come provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is unfortunate,” returned Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were they, then, so necessary?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They were indispensable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The major passed his hand across his brow. “Ah, <i>perbacco</i>,
      indispensable, were they?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to
      the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said the major, “there might be doubts raised.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be fatal to his interests.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>O peccato!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must know that in France they are very particular on these
      points; it is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say,
      ‘We love each other, and want you to marry us.’ Marriage is a
      civil affair in France, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you
      must have papers which undeniably establish your identity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is the misfortune! You see I have not these necessary papers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fortunately, I have them, though,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed?” said the major, who, seeing the object of his
      journey frustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his
      forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000
      francs—“ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes,
      that really is lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not at all wonder at it—one cannot think of everything;
      but, happily, the Abbé Busoni thought for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is an excellent person.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is extremely prudent and thoughtful.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is an admirable man,” said the major; “and he sent
      them to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here they are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The major clasped his hands in token of admiration. “You married
      Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del Monte-Cattini; here is the
      priest’s certificate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes indeed, there it is truly,” said the Italian, looking on
      with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And here is Andrea Cavalcanti’s baptismal register, given by
      the curé of Saravezza.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All quite correct.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take these documents, then; they do not concern me. You will give
      them to your son, who will, of course, take great care of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should think so, indeed! If he were to lose them——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, and if he were to lose them?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case,” replied the major, “it would be
      necessary to write to the curé for duplicates, and it would be some time
      before they could be obtained.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be a difficult matter to arrange,” said Monte
      Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Almost an impossibility,” replied the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these
      papers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I regard them as invaluable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Monte Cristo “as to the mother of the young
      man——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As to the mother of the young man——” repeated the
      Italian, with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As regards the Marchesa Corsinari——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really,” said the major, “difficulties seem to thicken
      upon us; will she be wanted in any way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “besides, has she not——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” said the major, “she has——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Paid the last debt of nature?”

    <p>
      “Alas, yes,” returned the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I knew that,” said Monte Cristo; “she has been dead
      these ten years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I am still mourning her loss,” exclaimed the major,
      drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping
      first the left and then the right eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would you have?” said Monte Cristo; “we are all
      mortal. Now, you understand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is
      useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from
      your son for fifteen years. Stories of gypsies, who steal children, are
      not at all in vogue in this part of the world, and would not be believed.
      You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces, and
      now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian world. That is
      the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived
      since the death of your wife. That will be sufficient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If they should hear of the separation——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes; what could I say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the Corsinari?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely. Had stolen away this child, in order that your name
      might become extinct.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is reasonable, since he is an only son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened
      remembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I was
      preparing a surprise for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An agreeable one?” asked the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his
      heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hum!” said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Someone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he
      was here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That who was here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your child—your son—your Andrea!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did guess it,” replied the major with the greatest possible
      coolness. “Then he is here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is,” said Monte Cristo; “when the valet de chambre
      came in just now, he told me of his arrival.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, very well, very well,” said the major, clutching the
      buttons of his coat at each exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear sir,” said Monte Cristo, “I understand your
      emotion; you must have time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime,
      go and prepare the young man for this much-desired interview, for I
      presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should quite imagine that to be the case,” said Cavalcanti.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to
      present him to me yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview
      will be private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of
      nature should be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by
      this door. He is a fine young man, of fair complexion—a little too
      fair, perhaps—pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for
      yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the way,” said the major, “you know I have only the
      2,000 francs which the Abbé Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon
      travelling expenses, and——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M.
      Cavalcanti. Well, here are 8,000 francs on account.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The major’s eyes sparkled brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does your excellency wish for a receipt?” said the major, at
      the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For what?” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Busoni.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a
      receipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I think,
      quite unnecessary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One word more,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will permit me to make one remark?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; pray do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed,” said the major, regarding himself with an air of
      complete satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however
      elegant in itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s unfortunate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can
      easily resume it when you leave Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what shall I wear?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What you find in your trunks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In my trunks? I have but one portmanteau.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of
      boring one’s self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always
      likes to march with as little baggage as possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is just the case—precisely so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent
      your luggage on before you. It has arrived at the Hôtel des Princes, Rue
      de Richelieu. It is there you are to take up your quarters.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, in these trunks——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in
      all you are likely to need,—your plain clothes and your uniform. On
      grand occasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well. Do
      not forget your crosses. They still laugh at them in France, and yet
      always wear them, for all that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, very well,” said the major, who was in ecstasy at
      the attention paid him by the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Monte Cristo, “that you have fortified
      yourself against all painful excitement, prepare yourself, my dear M.
      Cavalcanti, to meet your lost Andrea.” Saying which Monte Cristo
      bowed, and disappeared behind the tapestry, leaving the major fascinated
      beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at
      the hands of the count.

      Chapter 56. Andrea Cavalcanti
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Count of Monte
      Cristo entered the adjoining room, which Baptistin had designated as the
      drawing-room, and found there a young man, of graceful demeanor and
      elegant appearance, who had arrived in a cab about half an hour
      previously. Baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the
      person who presented himself at the door for admittance. He was certainly
      the tall young man with light hair, red beard, black eyes, and brilliant
      complexion, whom his master had so particularly described to him. When the
      count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa,
      tapping his boot with the gold-headed cane which he held in his hand. On
      perceiving the count he rose quickly. “The Count of Monte Cristo, I
      believe?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir, and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea
      Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count Andrea Cavalcanti,” repeated the young man,
      accompanying his words with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me, are
      you not?” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not mention that, because the signature seemed to me so
      strange.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The letter signed ‘Sinbad the Sailor,’ is it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly so. Now, as I have never known any Sinbad, with the
      exception of the one celebrated in the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, it is one of his descendants, and a great friend of mine; he
      is a very rich Englishman, eccentric almost to insanity, and his real name
      is Lord Wilmore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed? Then that explains everything that is extraordinary,”
      said Andrea. “He is, then, the same Englishman whom I met—at—ah—yes,
      indeed. Well, monsieur, I am at your service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If what you say be true,” replied the count, smiling, “perhaps
      you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your
      family?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, I will do so,” said the young man, with a
      quickness which gave proof of his ready invention. “I am (as you
      have said) the Count Andrea Cavalcanti, son of Major Bartolomeo
      Cavalcanti, a descendant of the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in
      the golden book at Florence. Our family, although still rich (for my
      father’s income amounts to half a million), has experienced many
      misfortunes, and I myself was, at the age of five years, taken away by the
      treachery of my tutor, so that for fifteen years I have not seen the
      author of my existence. Since I have arrived at years of discretion and
      become my own master, I have been constantly seeking him, but all in vain.
      At length I received this letter from your friend, which states that my
      father is in Paris, and authorizes me to address myself to you for
      information respecting him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting,”
      said Monte Cristo, observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction;
      “and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my
      friend Sinbad; for your father is indeed here, and is seeking you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room, had not once
      lost sight of the expression of the young man’s countenance; he had
      admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice; but at
      these words, so natural in themselves, “Your father is indeed here,
      and is seeking you,” young Andrea started, and exclaimed, “My
      father? Is my father here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most undoubtedly,” replied Monte Cristo; “your father,
      Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti.” The expression of terror which, for
      the moment, had overspread the features of the young man, had now
      disappeared. “Ah, yes, that is the name, certainly. Major Bartolomeo
      Cavalcanti. And you really mean to say; monsieur, that my dear father is
      here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir; and I can even add that I have only just left his
      company. The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to
      the quick; indeed, his griefs, hopes, and fears on that subject might
      furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem. At length, he one
      day received a letter, stating that the abductors of his son now offered
      to restore him, or at least to give notice where he might be found, on
      condition of receiving a large sum of money, by way of ransom. Your father
      did not hesitate an instant, and the sum was sent to the frontier of
      Piedmont, with a passport signed for Italy. You were in the south of
      France, I think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Andrea, with an embarrassed air, “I was
      in the south of France.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A carriage was to await you at Nice?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely so; and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to
      Turin, from Turin to Chambéry, from Chambéry to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and
      from Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed? Then your father ought to have met with you on the road,
      for it is exactly the same route which he himself took, and that is how we
      have been able to trace your journey to this place.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “But,” said Andrea, “if my father had met me, I doubt if
      he would have recognized me; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw
      me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, the voice of nature,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” interrupted the young man, “I had not looked
      upon it in that light.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” replied Monte Cristo “there is only one source of
      uneasiness left in your father’s mind, which is this—he is
      anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from
      him, how you have been treated by your persecutors, and if they have
      conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank.
      Finally, he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape
      the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed, and which is
      infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering; he wishes to
      discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been
      weakened by want of culture; and, in short, whether you consider yourself
      capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which
      your rank entitles you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir!” exclaimed the young man, quite astounded, “I hope
      no false report——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for myself, I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore,
      the philanthropist. I believe he found you in some unpleasant position,
      but do not know of what nature, for I did not ask, not being inquisitive.
      Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies, so you see you must have been
      interesting. He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position
      which you had lost, and that he would seek your father until he found him.
      He did seek, and has found him, apparently, since he is here now; and,
      finally, my friend apprised me of your coming, and gave me a few other
      instructions relative to your future fortune. I am quite aware that my
      friend Wilmore is peculiar, but he is sincere, and as rich as a gold mine,
      consequently, he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their
      ruining him, and I have promised to adhere to his instructions. Now, sir,
      pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you, as it
      comes in the way of my duty as your patron. I would wish to know if the
      misfortunes which have happened to you—misfortunes entirely beyond
      your control, and which in no degree diminish my regard for you—I
      would wish to know if they have not, in some measure, contributed to
      render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name
      entitle you to make a conspicuous figure?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” returned the young man, with a reassurance of manner,
      “make your mind easy on this score. Those who took me from my
      father, and who always intended, sooner or later, to sell me again to my
      original proprietor, as they have now done, calculated that, in order to
      make the most of their bargain, it would be politic to leave me in
      possession of all my personal and hereditary worth, and even to increase
      the value, if possible. I have, therefore, received a very good education,
      and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were
      treated in Asia Minor, whose masters made them grammarians, doctors, and
      philosophers, in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman
      market.” Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; it appeared as if he
      had not expected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti. “Besides,”
      continued the young man, “if there did appear some defect in
      education, or offence against the established forms of etiquette, I
      suppose it would be excused, in consideration of the misfortunes which
      accompanied my birth, and followed me through my youth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone, “you
      will do as you please, count, for you are the master of your own actions,
      and are the person most concerned in the matter, but if I were you, I
      would not divulge a word of these adventures. Your history is quite a
      romance, and the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers,
      strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though
      they be gilded like yourself. This is the kind of difficulty which I
      wished to represent to you, my dear count. You would hardly have recited
      your touching history before it would go forth to the world, and be deemed
      unlikely and unnatural. You would be no longer a lost child found, but you
      would be looked upon as an upstart, who had sprung up like a mushroom in
      the night. You might excite a little curiosity, but it is not everyone who
      likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant
      remark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I agree with you, monsieur,” said the young man, turning
      pale, and, in spite of himself, trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of
      his companion, “such consequences would be extremely unpleasant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless, you must not exaggerate the evil,” said Monte
      Cristo, “for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into
      another. You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and
      for a man of your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary;
      you must form honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the
      prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life.”
      Andrea visibly changed countenance. “I would offer myself as your
      surety and friendly adviser,” said Monte Cristo, “did I not
      possess a moral distrust of my best friends, and a sort of inclination to
      lead others to doubt them too; therefore, in departing from this rule, I
      should (as the actors say) be playing a part quite out of my line, and
      should, therefore, run the risk of being hissed, which would be an act of
      folly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However, your excellency,” said Andrea, “in
      consideration of Lord Wilmore, by whom I was recommended to you——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, certainly,” interrupted Monte Cristo; “but Lord
      Wilmore did not omit to inform me, my dear M. Andrea, that the season of
      your youth was rather a stormy one. Ah,” said the count, watching
      Andrea’s countenance, “I do not demand any confession from
      you; it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for
      from Lucca. You shall soon see him. He is a little stiff and pompous in
      his manner, and he is disfigured by his uniform; but when it becomes known
      that he has been for eighteen years in the Austrian service, all that will
      be pardoned. We are not generally very severe with the Austrians. In
      short, you will find your father a very presentable person, I assure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, sir, you have given me confidence; it is so long since we were
      separated, that I have not the least remembrance of him, and, besides, you
      know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a millionaire—his income is 500,000 francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said the young man, with anxiety, “I shall be
      sure to be placed in an agreeable position.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One of the most agreeable possible, my dear sir; he will allow you
      an income of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in
      Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You cannot control circumstances, my dear sir; ‘man proposes,
      and God disposes.’” Andrea sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said he, “so long as I do remain in Paris, and
      nothing forces me to quit it, do you mean to tell me that I may rely on
      receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I receive it from my father?” asked Andrea, with some
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you will receive it from your father personally, but Lord
      Wilmore will be the security for the money. He has, at the request of your
      father, opened an account of 6,000. francs a month at M. Danglars’,
      which is one of the safest banks in Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And does my father mean to remain long in Paris?” asked
      Andrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only a few days,” replied Monte Cristo. “His service
      does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks
      together.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my dear father!” exclaimed Andrea, evidently charmed with
      the idea of his speedy departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Therefore,” said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his meaning—“therefore
      I will not, for another instant, retard the pleasure of your meeting. Are
      you prepared to embrace your worthy father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope you do not doubt it.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Go, then, into the drawing-room, my young friend, where you will
      find your father awaiting you.” Andrea made a low bow to the count,
      and entered the adjoining room. Monte Cristo watched him till he
      disappeared, and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a
      picture, which, in sliding partly from the frame, discovered to view a
      small opening, so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing
      in the drawing-room now occupied by Cavalcanti and Andrea. The young man
      closed the door behind him, and advanced towards the major, who had risen
      when he heard steps approaching him. “Ah, my dear father!”
      said Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the count might hear him in the
      next room, “is it really you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do you do, my dear son?” said the major gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After so many years of painful separation,” said Andrea, in
      the same tone of voice, and glancing towards the door, “what a
      happiness it is to meet again!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed it is, after so long a separation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you not embrace me, sir?” said Andrea.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “If you wish it, my son,” said the major; and the two men
      embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to
      say, each rested his head on the other’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then we are once more reunited?” said Andrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Once more,” replied the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never more to be separated?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, as to that—I think, my dear son, you must be by this
      time so accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second
      country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact is,” said the young man, “that I should be
      exceedingly grieved to leave it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for me, you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca;
      therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I can.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But before you leave France, my dear father, I hope you will put me
      in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my
      descent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; I am come expressly on that account; it has cost me much
      trouble to find you, but I had resolved on giving them into your hands,
      and if I had to recommence my search, it would occupy all the few
      remaining years of my life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are these papers, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here they are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea seized the certificate of his father’s marriage and his own
      baptismal register, and after having opened them with all the eagerness
      which might be expected under the circumstances, he read them with a
      facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents, and
      with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the
      contents. When he had perused the documents, an indefinable expression of
      pleasure lighted up his countenance, and looking at the major with a most
      peculiar smile, he said, in very excellent Tuscan,—“Then there
      is no longer any such thing, in Italy as being condemned to the galleys?”
      The major drew himself up to his full height.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?—what do you mean by that question?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean that if there were, it would be impossible to draw up with
      impunity two such deeds as these. In France, my dear sir, half such a
      piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to
      Toulon for five years, for change of air.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you be good enough to explain your meaning?” said the
      major, endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest
      majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear M. Cavalcanti,” said Andrea, taking the major by the
      arm in a confidential manner, “how much are you paid for being my
      father?” The major was about to speak, when Andrea continued, in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense, I am going to set you an example of confidence, they give
      me 50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand
      that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent.” The major
      looked anxiously around him. “Make yourself easy, we are quite
      alone,” said Andrea; “besides, we are conversing in Italian.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then,” replied the major, “they paid me 50,000
      francs down.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur Cavalcanti,” said Andrea, “do you believe in
      fairy tales?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I used not to do so, but I really feel now almost obliged to have
      faith in them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had
      some proofs of their truth?” The major drew from his pocket a
      handful of gold. “Most palpable proofs,” said he, “as
      you may perceive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think, then, that I may rely on the count’s promises?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are sure he will keep his word with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the letter, but at the same time, remember, we must continue to
      play our respective parts. I, as a tender father——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended
      from you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whom do you mean by they?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who
      wrote the letter; you received one, did you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From a certain Abbé Busoni.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you any knowledge of him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I have never seen him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did he say in the letter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will promise not to betray me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the
      same.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then read for yourself;” and the major gave a letter into the
      young man’s hand. Andrea read in a low voice:
    </p>

      “You are poor; a miserable old age awaits you. Would you like to
      become rich, or at least independent? Set out immediately for Paris, and
      demand of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No. 30,
      the son whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken from you
      at five years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In order that
      you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter, you
      will find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in Florence, at
      Signor Gozzi’s; also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte
      Cristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs. Remember to go to the
      count on the 26th May at seven o’clock in the evening.

      “Abbé Busoni.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the same.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean?” said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same
      effect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From the Abbé Busoni?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From whom, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of
      Sinbad the Sailor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abbé Busoni?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are mistaken; there I am ahead of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have seen him, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make
      you as wise as myself, which it is not my intention to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did the letter contain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Read it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘You are poor, and your future prospects are dark and gloomy.
      Do you wish for a name? should you like to be rich, and your own master?’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Parbleu!</i>” said the young man; “was it possible
      there could be two answers to such a question?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take the post-chaise which you will find waiting at the Porte de
      Gênes, as you enter Nice; pass through Turin, Chambéry, and
      Pont-de-Beauvoisin. Go to the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des
      Champs-Élysées, on the 26th of May, at seven o’clock in the evening,
      and demand of him your father. You are the son of the Marchese Cavalcanti
      and the Marchesa Oliva Corsinari. The marquis will give you some papers
      which will certify this fact, and authorize you to appear under that name
      in the Parisian world. As to your rank, an annual income of 50,000 livres
      will enable you to support it admirably. I enclose a draft for 5,000
      livres, payable on M. Ferrea, banker at Nice, and also a letter of
      introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, whom I have directed to supply
      all your wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sinbad the Sailor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Humph,” said the major; “very good. You have seen the
      count, you say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have only just left him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And has he conformed to all that the letter specified?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you understand it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not in the least.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is a dupe somewhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At all events, it is neither you nor I.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; I agree with you there. We must play the game to the end, and
      consent to be blindfolded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you shall see; I promise you I will sustain my part to
      admiration.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never once doubted your doing so.” Monte Cristo chose this
      moment for re-entering the drawing-room. On hearing the sound of his
      footsteps, the two men threw themselves in each other’s arms, and
      while they were in the midst of this embrace, the count entered. “Well,
      marquis,” said Monte Cristo, “you appear to be in no way
      disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, your excellency, I am overwhelmed with delight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what are your feelings?” said Monte Cristo, turning to
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Happy father, happy son!” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is only one thing which grieves me,” observed the
      major, “and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my dear M. Cavalcanti, I trust you will not leave before I have
      had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am at your service, sir,” replied the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, sir,” said Monte Cristo, addressing Andrea, “make
      your confession.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi!</i> monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you hear what he says, major?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But do you understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your son says he requires money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what would you have me do?” said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You should furnish him with some of course,” replied Monte
      Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you,” said the count, at the same time advancing towards
      Andrea, and slipping a packet of bank-notes into the young man’s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is from your father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From my father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money? Well,
      then, he deputes me to give you this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, how good my dear father is!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Silence,” said Monte Cristo; “he does not wish you to
      know that it comes from him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I fully appreciate his delicacy,” said Andrea, cramming the
      notes hastily into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now, gentlemen, I wish you good-morning,” said Monte
      Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your
      excellency?” asked Cavalcanti.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Andrea, “when may we hope for that pleasure?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On Saturday, if you will—Yes.—Let me see—Saturday—I
      am to dine at my country house, at Auteuil, on that day, Rue de la
      Fontaine, No. 28. Several persons are invited, and among others, M.
      Danglars, your banker. I will introduce you to him, for it will be
      necessary he should know you, as he is to pay your money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Full dress?” said the major, half aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, certainly,” said the count; “uniform, cross,
      knee-breeches.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how shall I be dressed?” demanded Andrea.

      “Oh, very simply; black trousers, patent leather boots, white
      waistcoat, either a black or blue coat, and a long cravat. Go to Blin or
      Véronique for your clothes. Baptistin will tell you where, if you do not
      know their address. The less pretension there is in your attire, the
      better will be the effect, as you are a rich man. If you mean to buy any
      horses, get them of Devedeux, and if you purchase a phaeton, go to
      Baptiste for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At what hour shall we come?” asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “About half-past six.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will be with you at that time,” said the major. The two
      Cavalcanti bowed to the count, and left the house. Monte Cristo went to
      the window, and saw them crossing the street, arm in arm. “There go
      two miscreants;” said he, “it is a pity they are not really
      related!”—then, after an instant of gloomy reflection, “Come,
      I will go to see the Morrels,” said he; “I think that disgust
      is even more sickening than hatred.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 57. In the Lucern Patch
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ur readers must
      now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding M. de
      Villefort’s house, and, behind the gate, half screened from view by
      the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides spread their luxuriant
      branches, we shall find some people of our acquaintance. This time
      Maximilian was the first to arrive. He was intently watching for a shadow
      to appear among the trees, and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light
      step on the gravel walk. At length, the long-desired sound was heard, and
      instead of one figure, as he had expected, he perceived that two were
      approaching him. The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame
      Danglars and Eugénie, which had been prolonged beyond the time at which
      Valentine was expected. That she might not appear to fail in her promise
      to Maximilian, she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they should take
      a walk in the garden, being anxious to show that the delay, which was
      doubtless a cause of vexation to him, was not occasioned by any neglect on
      her part. The young man, with the intuitive perception of a lover, quickly
      understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed, and he
      was comforted. Besides, although she avoided coming within speaking
      distance, Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could see her pass and
      repass, and each time she went by, she managed, unperceived by her
      companion, to cast an expressive look at the young man, which seemed to
      say, “Have patience! You see it is not my fault.” And
      Maximilian was patient, and employed himself in mentally contrasting the
      two girls,—one fair, with soft languishing eyes, a figure gracefully
      bending like a weeping willow; the other a brunette, with a fierce and
      haughty expression, and as straight as a poplar. It is unnecessary to
      state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine did not suffer by the
      contrast. In about half an hour the girls went away, and Maximilian
      understood that Mademoiselle Danglars’ visit had at last come to an
      end. In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the garden alone. For fear that
      anyone should be observing her return, she walked slowly; and instead of
      immediately directing her steps towards the gate, she seated herself on a
      bench, and, carefully casting her eyes around, to convince herself that
      she was not watched, she presently arose, and proceeded quickly to join
      Maximilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-evening, Valentine,” said a well-known voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-evening, Maximilian; I know I have kept you waiting, but you
      saw the cause of my delay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars. I was not aware that you
      were so intimate with her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who told you we were intimate, Maximilian?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No one, but you appeared to be so. From the manner in which you
      walked and talked together, one would have thought you were two
      school-girls telling your secrets to each other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We were having a confidential conversation,” returned
      Valentine; “she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with
      M. de Morcerf; and I, on the other hand, was confessing to her how
      wretched it made me to think of marrying M. d’Epinay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Valentine!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you
      observed between me and Eugénie, as in speaking of the man whom I could
      not love, my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections
      were fixed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, how good you are to say so, Valentine! You possess a quality
      which can never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars. It is that indefinable
      charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the
      fruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Valentine, I assure you such is not the case. I was observing
      you both when you were walking in the garden, and, on my honor, without at
      all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars, I cannot
      understand how any man can really love her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact is, Maximilian, that I was there, and my presence had the
      effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; but tell me—it is a question of simple curiosity, and
      which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to
      Mademoiselle Danglars——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say.
      It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex,”
      interrupted Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You cannot, at least, deny that you are very harsh judges of each
      other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If we are so, it is because we generally judge under the influence
      of excitement. But return to your question.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de
      Morcerf on account of loving another?”

    <p>
      “I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugénie.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly
      intimate; own, now, that you did question her on the subject. Ah, I see
      you are smiling.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you are already aware of the conversation that passed, the
      wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a
      slight security.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, what did she say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She told me that she loved no one,” said Valentine; “that
      she disliked the idea of being married; that she would infinitely prefer
      leading an independent and unfettered life; and that she almost wished her
      father might lose his fortune, that she might become an artist, like her
      friend, Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you see——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what does that prove?” asked Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing,” replied Maximilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then why did you smile?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself,
      Valentine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you want me to go away?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, no, no. But do not let us lose time; you are the subject on
      which I wish to speak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, we must be quick, for we have scarcely ten minutes more to
      pass together.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi!</i>” said Maximilian, in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you are right; I am but a poor friend to you. What a life I
      cause you to lead, poor Maximilian, you who are formed for happiness! I
      bitterly reproach myself, I assure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what does it signify, Valentine, so long as I am satisfied,
      and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five
      minutes of your society, or two words from your lips? And I have also a
      deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts, harmonizing
      as ours do, and almost miraculously brought us together, to separate us at
      last.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those are kind and cheering words. You must hope for us both,
      Maximilian; that will make me at least partly happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why must you leave me so soon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know particulars. I can only tell you that Madame de
      Villefort sent to request my presence, as she had a communication to make
      on which a part of my fortune depended. Let them take my fortune, I am
      already too rich; and, perhaps, when they have taken it, they will leave
      me in peace and quietness. You would love me as much if I were poor, would
      you not, Maximilian?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I shall always love you. What should I care for either riches
      or poverty, if my Valentine was near me, and I felt certain that no one
      could deprive me of her? But do you not fear that this communication may
      relate to your marriage?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not think that is the case.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However it may be, Valentine, you must not be alarmed. I assure you
      that, as long as I live, I shall never love anyone else!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think to reassure me when you say that, Maximilian.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pardon me, you are right. I am a brute. But I was going to tell you
      that I met M. de Morcerf the other day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur Franz is his friend, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz, announcing
      his immediate return.” Valentine turned pale, and leaned her hand
      against the gate. “Ah heavens, if it were that! But no, the
      communication would not come through Madame de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because—I scarcely know why—but it has appeared as if
      Madame de Villefort secretly objected to the marriage, although she did
      not choose openly to oppose it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it so? Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not be in such a hurry to do that,” said Valentine, with a
      sad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If she objects to your marrying M. d’Epinay, she would be all
      the more likely to listen to any other proposition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Maximilian, it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort
      objects, it is marriage itself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Marriage? If she dislikes that so much, why did she ever marry
      herself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not understand me, Maximilian. About a year ago, I talked of
      retiring to a convent. Madame de Villefort, in spite of all the remarks
      which she considered it her duty to make, secretly approved of the
      proposition, my father consented to it at her instigation, and it was only
      on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the project.
      You can form no idea of the expression of that old man’s eye when he
      looks at me, the only person in the world whom he loves, and, I had almost
      said, by whom he is beloved in return. When he learned my resolution, I
      shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me, and the tears
      of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks. Ah,
      Maximilian, I experienced, at that moment, such remorse for my intention,
      that, throwing myself at his feet, I exclaimed,—‘Forgive me,
      pray forgive me, my dear grandfather; they may do what they will with me,
      I will never leave you.’ When I had ceased speaking, he thankfully
      raised his eyes to heaven, but without uttering a word. Ah, Maximilian, I
      may have much to suffer, but I feel as if my grandfather’s look at
      that moment would more than compensate for all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Valentine, you are a perfect angel, and I am sure I do not
      know what I—sabring right and left among the Bedouins—can have
      done to merit your being revealed to me, unless, indeed, heaven took into
      consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels. But
      tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining
      unmarried?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did I not tell you just now that I was rich, Maximilian—too
      rich? I possess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather
      and my grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran, will leave me
      as much, and M. Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir. My brother
      Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore, be poor in
      comparison with me. Now, if I had taken the veil, all this fortune would
      have descended to my father, and, in reversion, to his son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman
      should be so avaricious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you
      regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of
      maternal love.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your
      fortune to her son?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How could I make such a proposition, especially to a woman who
      always professes to be so entirely disinterested?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Valentine, I have always regarded our love in the light of
      something sacred; consequently, I have covered it with the veil of
      respect, and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul. No human being,
      not even my sister, is aware of its existence. Valentine, will you permit
      me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine started. “A friend, Maximilian; and who is this friend? I
      tremble to give my permission.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen, Valentine. Have you never experienced for anyone that
      sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of
      it had been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the
      first time you had ever met? Nay, further, have you never endeavored to
      recall the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse, and
      failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits must have
      held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the
      present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I
      first saw that extraordinary man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Extraordinary, did you say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have known him for some time, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Scarcely longer than eight or ten days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for
      eight or ten days? Ah, Maximilian, I had hoped you set a higher value on
      the title of friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your logic is most powerful, Valentine, but say what you will, I
      can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession
      of my mind. I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be
      associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me,
      and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to
      come, and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to
      his own will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must be a prophet, then,” said Valentine, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed,” said Maximilian, “I have often been almost
      tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a
      wonderful power of foretelling any future good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Valentine in a mournful tone, “do let me see
      this man, Maximilian; he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved
      sufficiently to make amends for all I have suffered.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My poor girl, you know him already.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Count of Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The same.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” cried Valentine, “he is too much the friend of
      Madame de Villefort ever to be mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The friend of Madame de Villefort! It cannot be; surely, Valentine,
      you are mistaken?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, indeed, I am not; for I assure you, his power over our
      household is almost unlimited. Courted by my step-mother, who regards him
      as the epitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has
      never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by
      Edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count’s large black
      eyes, runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which
      he is sure to find some delightful present,—M. de Monte Cristo
      appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all
      the members of our family.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have
      felt, or at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence. He
      meets Albert de Morcerf in Italy—it is to rescue him from the hands
      of the banditti; he introduces himself to Madame Danglars—it is that
      he may give her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before
      his door—it is that his Nubian may save them from destruction. This
      man evidently possesses the power of influencing events, both as regards
      men and things. I never saw more simple tastes united to greater
      magnificence. His smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that I forget it
      ever can be bitter to others. Ah, Valentine, tell me, if he ever looked on
      you with one of those sweet smiles? if so, depend on it, you will be
      happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Me?” said the young girl, “he never even glances at me;
      on the contrary, if I accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to
      avoid me. Ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that
      supernatural penetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he
      would have perceived that I was unhappy; and if he had been generous,
      seeing me sad and solitary, he would have used his influence to my
      advantage, and since, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have
      warmed my heart with one of his life-giving rays. You say he loves you,
      Maximilian; how do you know that he does? All would pay deference to an
      officer like you, with a fierce moustache and a long sabre, but they think
      they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, Valentine, I assure you you are mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If it were otherwise—if he treated me diplomatically—that
      is to say, like a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a
      footing in the house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of
      dictating to its occupants—he would, if it had been but once, have
      honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that I
      was unhappy, he understood that I could be of no use to him, and therefore
      paid no attention to me whatever. Who knows but that, in order to please
      Madame de Villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means
      in his power? It is not just that he should despise me so, without any
      reason. Ah, forgive me,” said Valentine, perceiving the effect which
      her words were producing on Maximilian: “I have done wrong, for I
      have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even
      know existed in my heart. I do not deny the influence of which you speak,
      or that I have not myself experienced it, but with me it has been
      productive of evil rather than good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Valentine,” said Morrel with a sigh, “we will not
      discuss the matter further. I will not make a confidant of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” said Valentine, “I see that I have given you
      pain. I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you.
      But, indeed, I am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction. Tell me
      what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for you.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “I own that your question embarrasses me, Valentine, for I cannot
      say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service. Still, as I
      have already told you I have an instinctive affection for him, the source
      of which I cannot explain to you. Has the sun done anything for me? No; he
      warms me with his rays, and it is by his light that I see you—nothing
      more. Has such and such a perfume done anything for me? No; its odor
      charms one of my senses—that is all I can say when I am asked why I
      praise it. My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his
      for me. A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something
      more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship. In his most
      simple actions, as well as in his most secret thoughts, I find a relation
      to my own. You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that, ever since I
      have known this man, I have involuntarily entertained the idea that all
      the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him. However, I
      have managed to live thirty years without this protection, you will say;
      but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning. He invited me to
      dine with him on Saturday, which was a very natural thing for him to do.
      Well, what have I learned since? That your mother and M. de Villefort are
      both coming to this dinner. I shall meet them there, and who knows what
      future advantages may result from the interview? This may appear to you to
      be no unusual combination of circumstances; nevertheless, I perceive some
      hidden plot in the arrangement—something, in fact, more than is
      apparent on a casual view of the subject. I believe that this singular
      man, who appears to fathom the motives of everyone, has purposely arranged
      for me to meet M. and Madame de Villefort, and sometimes, I confess, I
      have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in
      possession of the secret of our love.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good friend,” said Valentine, “I should take you for
      a visionary, and should tremble for your reason, if I were always to hear
      you talk in a strain similar to this. Is it possible that you can see
      anything more than the merest chance in this meeting? Pray reflect a
      little. My father, who never goes out, has several times been on the point
      of refusing this invitation; Madame de Villefort, on the contrary, is
      burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own
      house, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to
      accompany her. No, no; it is as I have said, Maximilian,—there is no
      one in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my grandfather,
      who is little better than a corpse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see that you are right, logically speaking,” said
      Maximilian; “but the gentle voice which usually has such power over
      me fails to convince me today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I feel the same as regards yourself.” said Valentine; “and
      I own that, if you have no stronger proof to give me——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have another,” replied Maximilian; “but I fear you
      will deem it even more absurd than the first.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the worse,” said Valentine, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is, nevertheless, conclusive to my mind. My ten years of service
      have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations, for I
      have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me
      to move at once either to the right or to the left, in order to escape the
      ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side, while it left me
      unharmed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Maximilian, why not attribute your escape to my constant
      prayers for your safety? When you are away, I no longer pray for myself,
      but for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, since you have known me,” said Morrel, smiling; “but
      that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance, Valentine.”

    <p>
      “You are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything;
      but let me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, look through this opening, and you will see the beautiful new
      horse which I rode here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, what a beautiful creature!” cried Valentine; “why
      did you not bring him close to the gate, so that I could talk to him and
      pat him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is, as you see, a very valuable animal,” said Maximilian.
      “You know that my means are limited, and that I am what would be
      designated a man of moderate pretensions. Well, I went to a horse dealer’s,
      where I saw this magnificent horse, which I have named Médéah. I asked the
      price; they told me it was 4,500 francs. I was, therefore, obliged to give
      it up, as you may imagine, but I own I went away with rather a heavy
      heart, for the horse had looked at me affectionately, had rubbed his head
      against me and, when I mounted him, had pranced in the most delightful way
      imaginable, so that I was altogether fascinated with him. The same evening
      some friends of mine visited me,—M. de Château-Renaud, M. Debray,
      and five or six other choice spirits, whom you do not know, even by name.
      They proposed a game of <i>bouillotte</i>. I never play, for I am not rich
      enough to afford to lose, or sufficiently poor to desire to gain. But I
      was at my own house, you understand, so there was nothing to be done but
      to send for the cards, which I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just as they were sitting down to table, M. de Monte Cristo
      arrived. He took his seat amongst them; they played, and I won. I am
      almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs. We separated
      at midnight. I could not defer my pleasure, so I took a cabriolet and
      drove to the horse dealer’s. Feverish and excited, I rang at the
      door. The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman, for I
      rushed at once to the stable. Médéah was standing at the rack, eating his
      hay. I immediately put on the saddle and bridle, to which operation he
      lent himself with the best grace possible; then, putting the 4,500 francs
      into the hands of the astonished dealer, I proceeded to fulfil my
      intention of passing the night in riding in the Champs-Élysées. As I rode
      by the count’s house I perceived a light in one of the windows, and
      fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain. Now,
      Valentine, I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse,
      and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love
      even me long. A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of
      poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common,
      every-day sort of attachment such as ours. But they are calling me. Do you
      hear?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, Valentine,” said Maximilian, “give me but one
      finger through this opening in the grating, one finger, the littlest
      finger of all, that I may have the happiness of kissing it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two
      shadows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you will, Valentine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall you be happy if I do what you wish?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes!” Valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only
      her finger but her whole hand through the opening. Maximilian uttered a
      cry of delight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards
      him, and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. The little hand
      was then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying
      towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own
      sensations.

      Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e will now relate
      what was passing in the house of the king’s attorney after the
      departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the time of the
      conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we have just
      detailed. M. de Villefort entered his father’s room, followed by
      Madame de Villefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and
      speaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years in
      his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in which
      he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way drawn out
      again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which reflected the
      whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move, which would have
      been impossible, he could see all who entered the room and everything
      which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although almost as immovable
      as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick and intelligent
      expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious courtesy, that they
      were come on business of an unexpected and official character. Sight and
      hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two solitary
      sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for
      nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of these
      senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied
      his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was
      like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across
      some desert place, and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence
      and obscurity. Noirtier’s hair was long and white, and flowed over
      his shoulders; while in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was
      concentrated, as it often happens with an organ which is used to the
      exclusion of the others, all the activity, address, force, and
      intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body; and so
      although the movement of the arm, the sound of the voice, and the agility
      of the body, were wanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all. He commanded
      with it; it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed. In
      short, his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a
      corpse with living eyes, and nothing could be more startling than to
      observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs,
      while the rest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived
      of the power of participation. Three persons only could understand this
      language of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and the
      old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw his
      father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he never
      took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all the old man’s
      happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by means of her
      love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read in Noirtier’s
      look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind. To this dumb
      language, which was so unintelligible to others, she answered by throwing
      her whole soul into the expression of her countenance, and in this manner
      were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the
      helpless invalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living one, but
      who, nevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration, united
      with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered
      utterly incapable of obeying its impulses. Valentine had solved the
      problem, and was able easily to understand his thoughts, and to convey her
      own in return, and, through her untiring and devoted assiduity, it was
      seldom that, in the ordinary transactions of every-day life, she failed to
      anticipate the wishes of the living, thinking mind, or the wants of the
      almost inanimate body. As to the servant, he had, as we have said, been
      with his master for five and twenty years, therefore he knew all his
      habits, and it was seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for
      anything, so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the
      invalid. Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the
      domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation
      which he was about to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the
      old man’s vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was
      only indifference and <i>ennui</i> which prevented him from so doing. He
      therefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois, and
      after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while Madame
      de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not
      come with us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one
      which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.
      Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Noirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long
      preamble, while, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to
      penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold
      and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,
      we are sure, meet with your approbation.” The eye of the invalid
      still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from
      obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind; he
      listened, nothing more. “Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we
      are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had the old man’s face
      been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than
      was now to be traced there. “The marriage will take place in less
      than three months,” said Villefort. Noirtier’s eye still
      retained its inanimate expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added,—“We
      thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have always
      entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only now remains
      for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined. It
      is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed;
      he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and every personal
      qualification likely to render Valentine supremely happy,—his name,
      moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you. It is M. Franz de Quesnel,
      Baron d’Epinay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      While his wife was speaking, Villefort had narrowly watched the old man’s
      countenance. When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of Franz, the
      pupil of M. Noirtier’s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids trembled
      with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual
      about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort
      and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred which had
      formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d’Epinay, well
      understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced;
      but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed the narrative
      begun by his wife. “Sir,” said he, “you are aware that
      Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year, which renders it
      important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance.
      Nevertheless, you have not been forgotten in our plans, and we have fully
      ascertained beforehand that Valentine’s future husband will consent,
      not to live in this house, for that might not be pleasant for the young
      people, but that you should live with them; so that you and Valentine, who
      are so attached to each other, would not be separated, and you would be
      able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto
      done, and thus, instead of losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as
      it will secure to you two children instead of one, to watch over and
      comfort you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Noirtier’s look was furious; it was very evident that something
      desperate was passing in the old man’s mind, for a cry of anger and
      grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,
      appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple
      with the struggle. Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “It is
      very warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.” He then returned to
      his place, but did not sit down. “This marriage,” added Madame
      de Villefort, “is quite agreeable to the wishes of M. d’Epinay
      and his family; besides, he had no relations nearer than an uncle and
      aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and his father having been
      assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he was but two years old; it
      naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own
      pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom acknowledged any other authority
      but that of his own will.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “That assassination was a mysterious affair,” said Villefort,
      “and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although
      suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person.” Noirtier
      made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” continued Villefort, “those to whom the guilt
      really belongs, by whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the
      justice of man may probably descend here, and the certain judgment of God
      hereafter, would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing
      such a peace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so
      ruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his
      emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled
      and shattered frame. “Yes, I understand,” was the reply
      contained in his look; and this look expressed a feeling of strong
      indignation, mixed with profound contempt. Villefort fully understood his
      father’s meaning, and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders.
      He then motioned to his wife to take leave. “Now sir,” said
      Madame de Villefort, “I must bid you farewell. Would you like me to
      send Edward to you for a short time?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by
      closing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he had
      some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he wanted
      Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the left. At
      Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his eyes.
      Provoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then
      shall I send Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly,
      thereby intimating that such was his wish. M. and Madame de Villefort
      bowed and left the room, giving orders that Valentine should be summoned
      to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling sure that she would have
      much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid.
      Valentine, with a color still heightened by emotion, entered the room just
      after her parents had quitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that
      her grandfather was suffering, and that there was much on his mind which
      he was wishing to communicate to her. “Dear grandpapa,” cried
      she, “what has happened? They have vexed you, and you are angry?”
      The paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent. “Who has
      displeased you? Is it my father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame de Villefort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Me?” The former sign was repeated. “Are you displeased
      with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment. M. Noirtier again closed
      his eyes. “And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be
      angry with me?” cried Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, and she continued. “I have not seen you all
      day. Has anyone been speaking to you against me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the old man’s look, with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M.
      and Madame de Villefort have just left this room, have they not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What
      was it then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of
      making my peace with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again
      tried to think what it could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to
      the old man. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have
      they not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the angry look.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on
      the subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping
      the matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They
      did not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered them
      by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear grandpapa.
      Pray forgive me.” But there was no look calculated to reassure her;
      all it seemed to say was, “It is not only your reserve which
      afflicts me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it, then?” asked the young girl. “Perhaps you
      think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you
      when I am married?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They told you, then, that M. d’Epinay consented to our all
      living together?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then why are you still vexed and grieved?” The old man’s
      eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection. “Yes, I
      understand,” said Valentine; “it is because you love me.”
      The old man assented. “And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not like M. Franz?” The eyes repeated several times,
      “No, no, no.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you are vexed with the engagement?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, listen,” said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees,
      and putting her arm round her grandfather’s neck, “I am vexed,
      too, for I do not love M. Franz d’Epinay.” An expression of
      intense joy illumined the old man’s eyes. “When I wished to
      retire into a convent, you remember how angry you were with me?” A
      tear trembled in the eye of the invalid. “Well,” continued
      Valentine, “the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape
      this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.” Noirtier’s
      breathing came thick and short. “Then the idea of this marriage
      really grieves you too? Ah, if you could but help me—if we could
      both together defeat their plan! But you are unable to oppose them,—you,
      whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so firm are nevertheless, as
      weak and unequal to the contest as I am myself. Alas, you, who would have
      been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and
      strength, can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows, without being
      able to take any active part in them. However, this is much, and calls for
      gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me
      your sympathy and kindness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words there appeared in Noirtier’s eye an expression of
      such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words
      there: “You are mistaken; I can still do much for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?” said
      Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” Noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on
      between him and Valentine when he wanted anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it you want, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine, and she
      endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to
      need; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated them
      aloud, then,—finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a
      constant <i>“No,”</i>—she said, “Come, since this
      plan does not answer, I will have recourse to another.” She then
      recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N. When she arrived
      at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the
      initial letter of the thing he wanted. “Ah,” said Valentine,
      “the thing you desire begins with the letter N; it is with N that we
      have to do, then. Well, let me see, what can you want that begins with N?
      Na—Ne—Ni—No”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, yes,” said the old man’s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, it is No, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” Valentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a
      desk before Noirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the odd man’s
      eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and
      down the columns. During the six years which had passed since Noirtier
      first fell into this sad state, Valentine’s powers of invention had
      been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising
      expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant
      practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man’s
      meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he
      wanted. At the word <i>Notary</i>, Noirtier made a sign to her to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Notary,” said she, “do you want a notary, dear
      grandpapa?” The old man again signified that it was a notary he
      desired.

    <p>
      “You would wish a notary to be sent for then?” said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall my father be informed of your wish?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa. Is that all
      you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” Valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to
      tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to
      M. Noirtier’s room. “Are you satisfied now?” inquired
      Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that,”—and
      the young girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child. M. de
      Villefort entered, followed by Barrois. “What do you want me for,
      sir?” demanded he of the paralytic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Valentine, “my grandfather wishes for a
      notary.” At this strange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and
      his father exchanged looks. “Yes,” motioned the latter, with a
      firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of Valentine and his
      old servant, who both knew what his wishes were, he was quite prepared to
      maintain the contest. “Do you wish for a notary?” asked
      Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Noirtier made no answer. “What do you want with a notary?”
      again repeated Villefort. The invalid’s eye remained fixed, by which
      expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable.
      “Is it to do us some ill turn? Do you think it is worth while?”
      said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still,” said Barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old
      servant, “if M. Noirtier asks for a notary, I suppose he really
      wishes for a notary; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one.”
      Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier, and never allowed his desires
      in any way to be contradicted.

      “Yes, I do want a notary,” motioned the old man, shutting his
      eyes with a look of defiance, which seemed to say, “and I should
      like to see the person who dares to refuse my request.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,”
      said Villefort; “but I shall explain to him your state of health,
      and make excuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most
      ridiculous one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind that,” said Barrois; “I shall go and fetch a
      notary, nevertheless,”—and the old servant departed
      triumphantly on his mission.

      Chapter 59. The Will
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s soon as Barrois
      had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious
      expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly understood the
      look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became clouded, and he
      knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and quietly awaited the
      arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of
      perfect indifference, at the same time giving a side look at Valentine,
      which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room.
      Three-quarters of an hour after, Barrois returned, bringing the notary
      with him. “Sir,” said Villefort, after the first salutations
      were over, “you were sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see here. All
      his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his voice also,
      and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments
      of his meaning.” Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine, which
      look was at once so earnest and imperative, that she answered immediately.
      “Sir,” said she, “I perfectly understand my grandfather’s
      meaning at all times.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is quite true,” said Barrois; “and that is what I
      told the gentleman as we walked along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Permit me,” said the notary, turning first to Villefort and
      then to Valentine—“permit me to state that the case in
      question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot
      proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The
      first thing necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be
      thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and
      wishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the
      approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the
      object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me, on
      account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite useless,
      and cannot be legally exercised.” The notary then prepared to
      retire. An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the
      procureur. Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of
      grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary. “Sir,”
      said she, “the language which I speak with my grandfather may be
      easily learnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it
      almost as well as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in
      order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the
      approbation or disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not
      affect the validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely
      requisite.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you
      presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is
      still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M. Noirtier,
      being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey his meaning by
      closing his eyes when he wishes to signify ‘yes,’ and to wink
      when he means ‘no.’ You now know quite enough to enable you to
      converse with M. Noirtier;—try.” Noirtier gave Valentine such
      a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the
      notary himself. “You have heard and understood what your
      granddaughter has been saying, sir, have you?” asked the notary.
      Noirtier closed his eyes. “And you approve of what she said—that
      is to say, you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those
      by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was you who sent for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To make your will?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original
      intentions?” The old man winked violently. “Well, sir,”
      said the young girl, “do you understand now, and is your conscience
      perfectly at rest on the subject?” But before the notary could
      answer, Villefort had drawn him aside. “Sir,” said he, “do
      you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock, such as
      M. Noirtier has received, without any detriment to his mental faculties?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not exactly that, sir,” said the notary, “which
      makes me uneasy, but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and
      intentions, so as to be able to get his answers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must see that to be an utter impossibility,” said
      Villefort. Valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier
      fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to
      the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said she, “that need not make you uneasy, however
      difficult it may at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain
      to you my grandfather’s thoughts, so as to put an end to all your
      doubts and fears on the subject. I have now been six years with M.
      Noirtier, and let him tell you if ever once, during that time, he has
      entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” signed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us try what we can do, then,” said the notary. “You
      accept this young lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that
      you wish to be drawn up?” Valentine named all the letters of the
      alphabet until she came to W. At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier
      gave her notice that she was to stop. “It is very evident that it is
      the letter W which M. Noirtier wants,” said the notary. “Wait,”
      said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated, “Wa—We—Wi”—The
      old man stopped her at the last syllable. Valentine then took the
      dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages.
      She passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the
      word “Will,” M. Noirtier’s eye bade her stop. “Will,”
      said the notary; “it is very evident that M. Noirtier is desirous of
      making his will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, yes,” motioned the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,”
      said the astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort. “Yes,”
      said the procureur, “and I think the will promises to be yet more
      extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the
      intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much
      interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of
      the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, no,” replied the eye of the paralytic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” said Villefort, “do you mean to say that
      Valentine is not interested in your will?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said the notary, whose interest had been greatly
      excited, and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of
      this extraordinary and picturesque scene, “what appeared so
      impossible to me an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable,
      and this may be a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the
      presence of seven witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the
      notary in the presence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not
      require very much more than the generality of wills. There are certain
      forms necessary to be gone through, and which are always the same. As to
      the details, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in
      which we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having
      had the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the
      subject. But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be
      contested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity,
      therefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom,
      will assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?”
      continued the notary, addressing the old man.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Yes,” looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the
      ready interpretation of his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is he going to do?” thought Villefort, whose position
      demanded much reserve, but who was longing to know what his father’s
      intentions were. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be
      sent, but Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master’s
      wishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his
      wife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had
      assembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also
      arrived. A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two
      officers of the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will, in
      order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are
      generally couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator,
      the first notary said, turning towards him,—“When an
      individual makes his will, it is generally in favor or in prejudice of
      some person.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation;
      you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own
      possessions?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation.
      Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than
      now, and if it was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle.
      They had formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting
      at a table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before
      the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we
      have alluded. “Your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?”
      asked he. Noirtier made a sign that it did. “Do you possess 400,000
      francs?” inquired the notary. Noirtier’s eye remained
      immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Five hundred thousand?” The same expression continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      “600,000—700,000—800,000—900,000?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Noirtier stopped him at the last-named sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are then in possession of 900,000 francs?” asked the
      notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In landed property?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In stock?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The stock is in your own hands?” The look which M. Noirtier
      cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew
      where to find. The old servant left the room, and presently returned,
      bringing with him a small casket. “Do you permit us to open this
      casket?” asked the notary. Noirtier gave his assent. They opened it,
      and found 900,000 francs in bank scrip. The first notary handed over each
      note, as he examined it, to his colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated. “It is
      all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its
      full force and vigor.” Then, turning towards the paralytic, he said,
      “You possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which, according to
      the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of
      about 40,000 livres?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Madame de Villefort, “there is not much doubt
      on that subject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter,
      Mademoiselle de Villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six
      years, and has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I
      had almost said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that
      she should reap the fruit of her devotion.” The eye of Noirtier
      clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false
      assent given by Madame de Villefort’s words and manner to the
      motives which she supposed him to entertain. “Is it, then, to
      Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave these 900,000 francs?”
      demanded the notary, thinking he had only to insert this clause, but
      waiting first for the assent of Noirtier, which it was necessary should be
      given before all the witnesses of this singular scene. Valentine, when her
      name was made the subject of discussion, had stepped back, to escape
      unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast down, and she was crying. The
      old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest
      tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked his
      eye in token of dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What,” said the notary, “do you not intend making
      Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are not making any mistake, are you?” said the notary;
      “you really mean to declare that such is not your intention?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” repeated Noirtier; “No.” Valentine raised
      her head, struck dumb with astonishment. It was not so much the conviction
      that she was disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability
      to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an
      act. But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that
      she exclaimed, “Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your
      fortune of which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have
      always enjoyed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes, most assuredly,” said the eyes of the paralytic, for
      he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake.
      “Thank you, thank you,” murmured she. The old man’s
      declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune
      had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the
      invalid, and said: “Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend
      leaving your fortune to your grandson, Edward de Villefort?” The
      winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and
      terrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No?” said the notary; “then, perhaps, it is to your
      son, M. de Villefort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.” The two notaries looked at each other in mute
      astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the
      testator. Villefort and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other
      from anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine;
      “you no longer seem to love any of us?” The old man’s
      eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife, and rested on Valentine
      with a look of unutterable fondness. “Well,” said she; “if
      you love me, grandpapa, try and bring that love to bear upon your actions
      at this present moment. You know me well enough to be quite sure that I
      have never thought of your fortune; besides, they say I am already rich in
      right of my mother—too rich, even. Explain yourself, then.”
      Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentine’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My hand?” said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Her hand!” exclaimed everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father’s
      mind is really impaired,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” cried Valentine suddenly, “I understand. It is my
      marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, yes,” signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a
      look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, this is too absurd,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse me, sir,” replied the notary; “on the contrary,
      the meaning of M. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily
      connect the train of ideas passing in his mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d’Epinay?”
      observed Valentine.

    <p>
      “I do not wish it,” said the eye of her grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you disinherit your granddaughter,” continued the notary,
      “because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” There was a profound silence. The two notaries were
      holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair.
      Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense
      gratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while Madame
      de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy,
      which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance. “But,”
      said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, “I consider
      that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question. I
      am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter’s
      hand. It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz d’Epinay—and
      she shall marry him.” Valentine sank weeping into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said the notary, “how do you intend disposing of
      your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on
      marrying M. Franz?” The old man gave no answer. “You will, of
      course, dispose of it in some way or other?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In favor of some member of your family?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?”
      pursued the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said the notary, “you are aware that the law does
      not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune
      which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?”
      Noirtier made no answer. “Do you still wish to dispose of all?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But they will contest the will after your death?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father knows me,” replied Villefort; “he is quite
      sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands
      that in my position I cannot plead against the poor.” The eye of
      Noirtier beamed with triumph. “What do you decide on, sir?”
      asked the notary of Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I
      know he never alters his mind. I am quite resigned. These 900,000 francs
      will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is
      ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and I shall,
      therefore, act according to my conscience.” Having said this,
      Villefort quitted the room with his wife, leaving his father at liberty to
      do as he pleased. The same day the will was made, the witnesses were
      brought, it was approved by the old man, sealed in the presence of all and
      given in charge to M. Deschamps, the family notary.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. and Madame de
      Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo, who had
      come to visit them in their absence, had been ushered into the
      drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there. Madame de Villefort, who
      had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her
      entertaining visitors so immediately, retired to her bedroom, while the
      procureur, who could better depend upon himself, proceeded at once to the
      salon. Although M. de Villefort flattered himself that, to all outward
      view, he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his
      mind, he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow, so
      much so that the count, whose smile was radiant, immediately noticed his
      sombre and thoughtful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi!</i>” said Monte Cristo, after the first
      compliments were over, “what is the matter with you, M. de
      Villefort? Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an
      indictment for a capital crime?” Villefort tried to smile. “No,
      count,” he replied, “I am the only victim in this case. It is
      I who lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which have
      caused it to be decided against me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To what do you refer?” said Monte Cristo with well-feigned
      interest. “Have you really met with some great misfortune?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, monsieur,” said Villefort with a bitter smile;
      “it is only a loss of money which I have sustained—nothing
      worth mentioning, I assure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said Monte Cristo, “the loss of a sum of money
      becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one
      of your philosophic spirit.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,” said
      Villefort, “though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting;
      but I am the more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please
      to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may
      blast the prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old
      man relapsed into second childhood.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you say?” said the count; “900,000 francs? It
      is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher. And who is
      the cause of all this annoyance?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father, as I told you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Noirtier? But I thought you told me he had become entirely
      paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak,
      nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described. I
      left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating his
      will to two notaries.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But to do this he must have spoken?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has done better than that—he has made himself understood.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How was such a thing possible?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you
      perceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear,” said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the
      room, “perhaps you exaggerate the evil.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-morning, madame,” said the count, bowing. Madame de
      Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious
      smiles. “What is this that M. de Villefort has been telling me?”
      demanded Monte Cristo “and what incomprehensible misfortune——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Incomprehensible is not the word,” interrupted the procureur,
      shrugging his shoulders. “It is an old man’s caprice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Madame de Villefort; “and it is still
      entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will, which is now in
      prejudice of Valentine, to be altered in her favor.” The count, who
      perceived that M. and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in
      parables, appeared to pay no attention to the conversation, and feigned to
      be busily engaged in watching Edward, who was mischievously pouring some
      ink into the bird’s water-glass. “My dear,” said
      Villefort, in answer to his wife, “you know I have never been
      accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor have I ever considered
      that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod. Nevertheless, it
      is necessary that my will should be respected in my family, and that the
      folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to
      overturn a project which I have entertained for so many years. The Baron d’Epinay
      was my friend, as you know, and an alliance with his son is the most
      suitable thing that could possibly be arranged.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think,” said Madame de Villefort, “that
      Valentine is in league with him? She has always been opposed to this
      marriage, and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen
      and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” said Villefort, “believe me, a fortune of
      900,000 francs is not so easily renounced.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world,
      sir, since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering
      a convent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind,” replied Villefort; “I say that this
      marriage <i>shall</i> be consummated.”

    <p>
      “Notwithstanding your father’s wishes to the contrary?”
      said Madame de Villefort, selecting a new point of attack. “That is
      a serious thing.” Monte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening,
      heard however, every word that was said. “Madame,” replied
      Villefort “I can truly say that I have always entertained a high
      respect for my father, because, to the natural feeling of relationship was
      added the consciousness of his moral superiority. The name of father is
      sacred in two senses; he should be reverenced as the author of our being
      and as a master whom we ought to obey. But, under the present
      circumstances, I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who,
      because he hated the father, vents his anger on the son. It would be
      ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices. I shall still
      continue to preserve the same respect toward M. Noirtier; I will suffer,
      without complaint, the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me;
      but I shall remain firm in my determination, and the world shall see which
      party has reason on his side. Consequently I shall marry my daughter to
      the Baron Franz d’Epinay, because I consider it would be a proper
      and eligible match for her to make, and, in short, because I choose to
      bestow my daughter’s hand on whomever I please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort
      had frequently solicited during this speech. “What? Do you say that
      M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to
      marry M. le Baron Franz d’Epinay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir, that is the reason,” said Villefort, shrugging his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The apparent reason, at least,” said Madame de Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>real</i> reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I want to know in what way M. d’Epinay can have
      displeased your father more than any other person?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe I know M. Franz d’Epinay,” said the count;
      “is he not the son of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d’Epinay
      by Charles X.?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The same,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M.
      Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so
      selfish in their affection,” said Madame de Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Monte Cristo “do you not know any cause for
      this hatred?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, <i>ma foi</i>, who is to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps it is some political difference?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father and the Baron d’Epinay lived in the stormy times of
      which I only saw the ending,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was not your father a Bonapartist?” asked Monte Cristo;
      “I think I remember that you told me something of that kind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,” said
      Villefort, carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; “and
      the senator’s robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only
      served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him. When my
      father conspired, it was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons;
      for M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian
      schemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and
      he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories
      of The Mountain,—theories that never shrank from any means that were
      deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Monte Cristo, “it is just as I thought; it
      was politics which brought Noirtier and M. d’Epinay into personal
      contact. Although General d’Epinay served under Napoleon, did he not
      still retain royalist sentiments? And was he not the person who was
      assassinated one evening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had
      been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?”
      Villefort looked at the count almost with terror. “Am I mistaken,
      then?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,” said
      Madame de Villefort; “and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds
      that M. de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection
      the two children of these inveterate enemies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was a sublime and charitable thought,” said Monte Cristo,
      “and the whole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see
      Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d’Epinay.”
      Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in
      his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just
      uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and prevented him
      from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile he was so
      constantly in the habit of assuming. “Although,” said
      Villefort, “it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her
      grandfather’s fortune, I do not think that M. d’Epinay will be
      frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in greater
      esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice everything in order
      to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that Valentine is rich in
      right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit the
      fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran, her mother’s parents, who
      both love her tenderly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,”
      said Madame de Villefort; “besides, they are to come to Paris in
      about a month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not
      consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up
      with M. Noirtier.” The count listened with satisfaction to this tale
      of wounded self-love and defeated ambition. “But it seems to me,”
      said Monte Cristo, “and I must begin by asking your pardon for what
      I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de
      Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he
      cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice
      which it is impossible to describe; “is it not unjust—shamefully
      unjust? Poor Edward is as much M. Noirtier’s grandchild as
      Valentine, and yet, if she had not been going to marry M. Franz, M.
      Noirtier would have left her all his money; and supposing Valentine to be
      disinherited by her grandfather, she will still be three times richer than
      he.” The count listened and said no more. “Count,” said
      Villefort, “we will not entertain you any longer with our family
      misfortunes. It is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable
      institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance
      without any reason for doing so, but I shall have the satisfaction of
      knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and feeling. M. d’Epinay,
      to whom I had promised the interest of this sum, shall receive it, even if
      I endure the most cruel privations.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However,” said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea
      which incessantly occupied her mind, “perhaps it would be better to
      explain this unlucky affair to M. d’Epinay, in order to give him the
      opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de
      Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that would be a great pity,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A great pity,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly,” said Villefort, moderating the tones of his
      voice, “a marriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort
      of discredit on a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so
      anxious to put an end to, will instantly gain ground. No, it will all go
      well; M. d’Epinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself
      more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were
      actuated by a decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I agree with M. de Villefort,” said Monte Cristo, fixing his
      eyes on Madame de Villefort; “and if I were sufficiently intimate
      with him to allow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have
      been told M. d’Epinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once
      beyond all possibility of revocation. I will answer for the success of a
      project which will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort.” The
      procureur arose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife slightly
      changed color. “Well, that is all that I wanted, and I will be
      guided by a counsellor such as you are,” said he, extending his hand
      to Monte Cristo. “Therefore let everyone here look upon what has
      passed today as if it had not happened, and as though we had never thought
      of such a thing as a change in our original plans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said the count, “the world, unjust as it is, will
      be pleased with your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M.
      d’Epinay, even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any
      dowry, which he will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering
      a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and
      fulfil a duty.” At the conclusion of these words, the count rose to
      depart. “Are you going to leave us, count?” said Madame de
      Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you
      of your promise for Saturday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you fear that we should forget it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many
      important and urgent occupations.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My husband has given me his word, sir,” said Madame de
      Villefort; “you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has
      everything to lose, and surely there is more reason for his doing so where
      he has everything to gain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And,” said Villefort, “is it at your house in the
      Champs-Élysées that you receive your visitors?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Monte Cristo, “which is precisely the reason
      which renders your kindness more meritorious,—it is in the country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the country?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very near, only half a league from the Barriers,—it is at
      Auteuil.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At Auteuil?” said Villefort; “true, Madame de Villefort
      told me you lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was
      taken. And in what part of Auteuil do you reside?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rue de la Fontaine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rue de la Fontaine!” exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone;
      “at what number?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. 28.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” cried Villefort, “was it you who bought M. de
      Saint-Méran’s house!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did it belong to M. de Saint-Méran?” demanded Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Madame de Villefort; “and, would you
      believe it, count——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Believe what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think this house pretty, do you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think it charming.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my husband would never live in it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?” returned Monte Cristo, “that is a prejudice on
      your part, M. de Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not like Auteuil, sir,” said the procureur, making an
      evident effort to appear calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive
      me of the pleasure of your company, sir,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, count,—I hope—I assure you I shall do my best,”
      stammered Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Monte Cristo, “I allow of no excuse. On
      Saturday, at six o’clock. I shall be expecting you, and if you fail
      to come, I shall think—for how do I know to the contrary?—that
      this house, which has remained uninhabited for twenty years, must have
      some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will come, count,—I will be sure to come,” said
      Villefort eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you,” said Monte Cristo; “now you must permit me
      to take my leave of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur,”
      said Madame de Villefort, “and you were about to tell us why when
      your attention was called to some other subject.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed madame,” said Monte Cristo: “I scarcely know if
      I dare tell you where I am going.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense; say on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused
      for hours together.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A telegraph. So now I have told my secret.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A telegraph?” repeated Madame de Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road
      on a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every
      direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I
      assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could
      not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be
      made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of
      three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at
      one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite
      extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part
      of the sender of the message. I began to think of genii, sylphs, gnomes,
      in short, of all the ministers of the occult sciences, until I laughed
      aloud at the freaks of my own imagination. Now, it never occurred to me to
      wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects, with their long black
      claws, for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little
      human genius fagged to death with cabals, factions, and government
      intrigues. But one fine day I learned that the mover of this telegraph was
      only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred francs a year, and employed
      all day, not in studying the heavens like an astronomer, or in gazing on
      the water like an angler, or even in enjoying the privilege of observing
      the country around him, but all his monotonous life was passed in watching
      his white-bellied, black-clawed fellow insect, four or five leagues
      distant from him. At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis
      more closely, and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by
      these insect-actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling
      different pieces of string.”

      “I am.”

    <p>
      “What telegraph do you intend visiting? that of the home department,
      or of the observatory?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand
      things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try to
      explain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do not
      understand. <i>Ma foi!</i> I should wish to keep my illusions concerning
      insects unimpaired; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I
      had formed of my fellow-creatures. I shall, therefore, not visit either of
      these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find a
      good-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is employed
      to work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are a singular man,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What line would you advise me to study?”

    <p>
      “The one that is most in use just at this time.”

    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might
      explain to you——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Monte Cristo; “since, as I told you before, I
      do not wish to comprehend it. The moment I understand it there will no
      longer exist a telegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from
      M. Duchâtel, or from M. Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne,
      mystified by two Greek words, <i>têle</i>, <i>graphein</i>. It is the
      insect with black claws, and the awful word which I wish to retain in my
      imagination in all its purity and all its importance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you
      will not be able to see anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, you frighten me. Which is the nearest way? Bayonne?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; the road to Bayonne.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And afterwards the road to Châtillon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the tower of Montlhéry, you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you. Good-bye. On Saturday I will tell you my impressions
      concerning the telegraph.” At the door the count was met by the two
      notaries, who had just completed the act which was to disinherit
      Valentine, and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a
      thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ot on the same
      night as he had stated, but the next morning, the Count of Monte Cristo
      went out by the Barrière d’Enfer, taking the road to Orléans.
      Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the telegraph, which
      flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count reached the tower
      of Montlhéry, situated, as everyone knows, upon the highest point of the
      plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began
      to ascend by a little winding path, about eighteen inches wide; when he
      reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge, upon which green
      fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure, and was not long in
      finding a little wooden gate, working on willow hinges, and fastened with
      a nail and string. The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate opened,
      and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet long by
      twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which contained the
      ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the other by the old
      tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers. No one would have
      thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten, floral-decked tower (which
      might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her
      grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have been capable of
      telling strange things, if,—in addition to the menacing ears which
      the proverb says all walls are provided with,—it had also a voice.
      The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border of thick
      box, of many years’ growth, and of a tone and color that would have
      delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens. This path was formed
      in the shape of the figure of 8, thus, in its windings, making a walk of
      sixty feet in a garden of only twenty.

      Never had Flora, the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners, been honored
      with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in
      this little enclosure. In fact, of the twenty rose-trees which formed the
      <i>parterre</i>, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor were there
      evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to
      plants growing in a damp soil. And yet it was not because the damp had
      been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as soot, the thick foliage
      of the trees betrayed its presence; besides, had natural humidity been
      wanting, it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means,
      thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of the corners of the garden, and
      upon which were stationed a frog and a toad, who, from antipathy, no
      doubt, always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin. There was
      not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths, or a weed in the
      flower-beds; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums, her
      cacti, and her rhododendrons, in her porcelain <i>jardinière</i> with more
      pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little
      enclosure. Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened
      the string to the nail, and cast a look around.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The man at the telegraph,” said he, “must either engage
      a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture.” Suddenly
      he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with
      leaves; the something rose, uttering an exclamation of astonishment, and
      Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old, who was
      plucking strawberries, which he was placing upon grape leaves. He had
      twelve leaves and about as many strawberries, which, on rising suddenly,
      he let fall from his hand. “You are gathering your crop, sir?”
      said Monte Cristo, smiling.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Excuse me, sir,” replied the man, raising his hand to his
      cap; “I am not up there, I know, but I have only just come down.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,”
      said the count; “gather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any
      left.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have ten left,” said the man, “for here are eleven,
      and I had twenty-one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised;
      the spring has been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir.
      This is the reason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have
      this year, you see, eleven, already plucked—twelve, thirteen,
      fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Ah, I miss three, they
      were here last night, sir—I am sure they were here—I counted
      them. It must be the son of Mère Simon who has stolen them; I saw him
      strolling about here this morning. Ah, the young rascal—stealing in
      a garden—he does not know where that may lead him to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, it is wrong,” said Monte Cristo, “but you
      should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course,” said the gardener, “but that does not make
      it the less unpleasant. But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps you are
      an officer that I am detaining here.” And he glanced timidly at the
      count’s blue coat.

    <p>
      “Calm yourself, my friend,” said the count, with the smile
      which he made at will either terrible or benevolent, and which now
      expressed only the kindliest feeling; “I am not an inspector, but a
      traveller, brought here by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes
      you to lose your time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my time is not valuable,” replied the man with a
      melancholy smile. “Still it belongs to government, and I ought not
      to waste it; but, having received the signal that I might rest for an hour”
      (here he glanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the
      enclosure of Montlhéry, even a sun-dial), “and having ten minutes
      before me, and my strawberries being ripe, when a day longer—by-the-by,
      sir, do you think dormice eat them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, I should think not,” replied Monte Cristo; “dormice
      are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? Did the Romans eat them?” said the gardener—“ate
      dormice?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have read so in Petronius,” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really? They can’t be nice, though they do say ‘as fat
      as a dormouse.’ It is not a wonder they are fat, sleeping all day,
      and only waking to eat all night. Listen. Last year I had four apricots—they
      stole one, I had one nectarine, only one—well, sir, they ate half of
      it on the wall; a splendid nectarine—I never ate a better.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You ate it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is to say, the half that was left—you understand; it was
      exquisite, sir. Ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels; like
      Mère Simon’s son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries. But
      this year,” continued the horticulturist, “I’ll take
      care it shall not happen, even if I should be forced to sit by the whole
      night to watch when the strawberries are ripe.” Monte Cristo had
      seen enough. Every man has a devouring passion in his heart, as every
      fruit has its worm; that of the telegraph man was horticulture. He began
      gathering the grape-leaves which screened the sun from the grapes, and won
      the heart of the gardener. “Did you come here, sir, to see the
      telegraph?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, if it isn’t contrary to the rules.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” said the gardener; “not in the least, since
      there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have been told,” said the count, “that you do not
      always yourselves understand the signals you repeat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is true, sir, and that is what I like best,” said the
      man, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you like that best?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because then I have no responsibility. I am a machine then, and
      nothing else, and so long as I work, nothing more is required of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible,” said Monte Cristo to himself, “that I
      can have met with a man that has no ambition? That would spoil my plans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, “the
      ten minutes are almost up; I must return to my post. Will you go up with
      me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I follow you.” Monte Cristo entered the tower, which was
      divided into three stories. The tower contained implements, such as
      spades, rakes, watering-pots, hung against the wall; this was all the
      furniture. The second was the man’s conventional abode, or rather
      sleeping-place; it contained a few poor articles of household furniture—a
      bed, a table, two chairs, a stone pitcher—and some dry herbs, hung
      up to the ceiling, which the count recognized as sweet peas, and of which
      the good man was preserving the seeds; he had labelled them with as much
      care as if he had been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?”
      asked Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary that
      was so tedious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is the pay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand francs, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; but then we are lodged, as you perceive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo looked at the room. They passed to the third story; it was
      the telegraph room. Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by
      which the machine was worked. “It is very interesting,” he
      said, “but it must be very tedious for a lifetime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. At first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but at the
      end of a year I became used to it; and then we have our hours of
      recreation, and our holidays.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Holidays?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When we have a fog.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, to be sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those are indeed holidays to me; I go into the garden, I plant, I
      prune, I trim, I kill the insects all day long.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long have you been here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fifty-five years old.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long must you have served to claim the pension?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sir, twenty-five years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how much is the pension?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A hundred crowns.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor humanity!” murmured Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did you say, sir?” asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was saying it was very interesting.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All you were showing me. And you really understand none of these
      signals?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have you never tried to understand them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never. Why should I?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But still there are some signals only addressed to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you understand them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are always the same.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And they mean——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Nothing new</i>; <i>You have an hour</i>; or <i>Tomorrow</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is simple enough,” said the count; “but look, is
      not your correspondent putting itself in motion?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes; thank you, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is it saying—anything you understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; it asks if I am ready.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you reply?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the same sign, which, at the same time, tells my right-hand
      correspondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my left-hand
      correspondent to prepare in his turn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very ingenious,” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will see,” said the man proudly; “in five minutes
      he will speak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have, then, five minutes,” said Monte Cristo to himself;
      “it is more time than I require. My dear sir, will you allow me to
      ask you a question?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are fond of gardening?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Passionately.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty
      feet, an enclosure of two acres?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, I should make a terrestrial paradise of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You live badly on your thousand francs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Badly enough; but yet I do live.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, the garden is not large.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat
      everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, they are my scourges.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while
      your right-hand correspondent was telegraphing——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should not see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what would happen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I could not repeat the signals.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not having repeated them, through negligence, I should be fined.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How much?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A hundred francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The tenth of your income—that would be fine work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has it ever happened to you?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Once, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is another case; I should be turned off, and lose my
      pension.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Three hundred francs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A hundred crowns, yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely to do
      any of these things.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not even for fifteen years’ wages? Come, it is worth thinking
      about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For fifteen thousand francs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, you alarm me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, you are tempting me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary, do not look at him, but at this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? Do you not know these bits of paper?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bank-notes!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly; there are fifteen of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And whose are they?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yours, if you like.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mine?” exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; yours—your own property.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let him signal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to
      take my bank-notes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is
      impatient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind—take these;” and the count placed the packet
      in the man’s hands. “Now this is not all,” he said;
      “you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall still have my place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondent’s
      message.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sir, what are you proposing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A jest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, unless you force me——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think I can effectually force you;” and Monte Cristo drew
      another packet from his pocket. “Here are ten thousand more francs,”
      he said, “with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket, they
      will make twenty-five thousand. With five thousand you can buy a pretty
      little house with two acres of land; the remaining twenty thousand will
      bring you in a thousand francs a year.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A garden with two acres of land!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And a thousand francs a year.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, heavens!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, take them,” and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What am I to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing very difficult.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To repeat these signs.” Monte Cristo took a paper from his
      pocket, upon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the
      order in which they were to be worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, you see it will not take long.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.” The
      shot told; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his brow, the
      man executed, one after the other, the three signs given by the count, in
      spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand correspondent, who,
      not understanding the change, began to think the gardener had gone mad. As
      to the left-hand one, he conscientiously repeated the same signals, which
      were finally transmitted to the Minister of the Interior. “Now you
      are rich,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the man, “but at what a price!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen, friend,” said Monte Cristo. “I do not wish to
      cause you any remorse; believe me, then, when I swear to you that you have
      wronged no man, but on the contrary have benefited mankind.” The man
      looked at the bank-notes, felt them, counted them, turned pale, then red,
      then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water, but he had no time to
      reach the water-jug, and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs. Five
      minutes after the new telegram reached the minister, Debray had the horses
      put to his carriage, and drove to Danglars’ house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has your husband any Spanish bonds?” he asked of the
      baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so, indeed! He has six millions’ worth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must sell them at whatever price.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned to
      Spain.”

      “How do you know?” Debray shrugged his shoulders. “The
      idea of asking how I hear the news,” he said. The baroness did not
      wait for a repetition; she ran to her husband, who immediately hastened to
      his agent, and ordered him to sell at any price. When it was seen that
      Danglars sold, the Spanish funds fell directly. Danglars lost five hundred
      thousand francs; but he rid himself of all his Spanish shares. The same
      evening the following was read in <i>Le Messager</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      “[By telegraph.] The king, Don Carlos, has escaped the vigilance of
      his guardians at Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian
      frontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars, who
      had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only lost
      five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept their
      shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as ruined, and
      passed a very bad night. Next morning <i>Le Moniteur</i> contained the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was without any foundation that <i>Le Messager</i> yesterday
      announced the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king
      (Don Carlos) has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment
      of profound peace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to
      the fog, was the cause of this error.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen. This,
      reckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference of
      a million to Danglars. “Good,” said Monte Cristo to Morrel,
      who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of
      fortune of which Danglars had been the victim, “I have just made a
      discovery for twenty-five thousand francs, for which I would have paid a
      hundred thousand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What have you discovered?” asked Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice
      that eat his peaches.”

    <h2>
      Chapter 62. Ghosts
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t first sight, the
      exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications of splendor, nothing
      one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent Count of
      Monte Cristo; but this simplicity was according to the will of its master,
      who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside. The splendor was
      within. Indeed, almost before the door opened, the scene changed. M.
      Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing, and in
      the rapidity with which it was executed. It is told that the Duc d’Antin
      removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed Louis XIV.;
      in three days M. Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars,
      large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house, and
      in the foreground, instead of the usual paving-stones, half hidden by the
      grass, there extended a lawn but that morning laid down, and upon which
      the water was yet glistening. For the rest, the orders had been issued by
      the count; he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio, marking the spot
      where each tree was to be planted, and the shape and extent of the lawn
      which was to take the place of the paving-stones. Thus the house had
      become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely
      knew it, encircled as it was by a framework of trees. The overseer would
      not have objected, while he was about it, to have made some improvements
      in the garden, but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched.
      Bertuccio made amends, however, by loading the antechambers, staircases,
      and mantle-pieces with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, above all, manifested the shrewdness of the steward, and the
      profound science of the master, the one in carrying out the ideas of the
      other, was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and
      gloomy, impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the
      smell of time, had in a single day acquired the aspect of life, was
      scented with its master’s favorite perfumes, and had the very light
      regulated according to his wish. When the count arrived, he had under his
      touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures; his
      dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the antechamber; the birds,
      whose songs delighted him, cheered him with their music; and the house,
      awakened from its long sleep, like the sleeping beauty in the wood, lived,
      sang, and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished, and in which,
      when we are forced to leave them, we leave a part of our souls. The
      servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard; some, belonging to the
      kitchens, gliding down the stairs, restored but the previous day, as if
      they had always inhabited the house; others filling the coach-houses,
      where the equipages, encased and numbered, appeared to have been installed
      for the last fifty years; and in the stables the horses replied with
      neighs to the grooms, who spoke to them with much more respect than many
      servants pay their masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall, and
      contained upwards of two thousand volumes; one division was entirely
      devoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the
      day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and
      gold binding. On the other side of the house, to match with the library,
      was the conservatory, ornamented with rare flowers, that bloomed in china
      jars; and in the midst of the greenhouse, marvellous alike to sight and
      smell, was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been abandoned
      during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth. One
      chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio. Before this
      room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and go out by the back
      staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and Bertuccio with terror.
      At five o’clock precisely, the count arrived before the house at
      Auteuil, followed by Ali. Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with
      impatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some compliments, while,
      at the same time, he feared to have frowns. Monte Cristo descended into
      the courtyard, walked all over the house, without giving any sign of
      approbation or pleasure, until he entered his bedroom, situated on the
      opposite side to the closed room; then he approached a little piece of
      furniture, made of rosewood, which he had noticed at a previous visit.
      “That can only be to hold gloves,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will your excellency deign to open it?” said the delighted
      Bertuccio, “and you will find gloves in it.” Elsewhere the
      count found everything he required—smelling-bottles, cigars,
      knick-knacks.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Good,” he said; and M. Bertuccio left enraptured, so great,
      so powerful, and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who
      surrounded him. At precisely six o’clock the clatter of horses’
      hoofs was heard at the entrance door; it was our captain of Spahis, who
      had arrived on Médéah. “I am sure I am the first,” cried
      Morrel; “I did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself, before
      everyone came. Julie and Emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you. Ah,
      really this is magnificent! But tell me, count, will your people take care
      of my horse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not alarm yourself, my dear Maximilian—they understand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean, because he wants petting. If you had seen at what a pace he
      came—like the wind!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should think so,—a horse that cost 5,000 francs!”
      said Monte Cristo, in the tone which a father would use towards a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you regret them?” asked Morrel, with his open laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I? Certainly not,” replied the count. “No; I should
      only regret if the horse had not proved good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is so good, that I have distanced M. de Château-Renaud, one of
      the best riders in France, and M. Debray, who both mount the minister’s
      Arabians; and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars, who
      always go at six leagues an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then they follow you?” asked Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “See, they are here.” And at the same minute a carriage with
      smoking horses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate,
      which opened before them. The carriage drove round, and stopped at the
      steps, followed by the horsemen. The instant Debray had touched the
      ground, he was at the carriage-door. He offered his hand to the baroness,
      who, descending, took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to
      everyone but Monte Cristo. But nothing escaped the count’s notice,
      and he observed a little note, passed with the facility that indicates
      frequent practice, from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the
      minister’s secretary. After his wife the banker descended, as pale
      as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage. Madame
      Danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be
      interpreted by Monte Cristo, around the courtyard, over the peristyle, and
      across the front of the house, then, repressing a slight emotion, which
      must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color, she
      ascended the steps, saying to Morrel, “Sir, if you were a friend of
      mine, I should ask you if you would sell your horse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace, and then turned
      round to Monte Cristo, as if to ask him to extricate him from his
      embarrassment. The count understood him. “Ah, madame,” he
      said, “why did you not make that request of me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With you, sir,” replied the baroness, “one can wish for
      nothing, one is so sure to obtain it. If it were so with M. Morrel——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately,” replied the count, “I am witness that
      M. Morrel cannot give up his horse, his honor being engaged in keeping it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He laid a wager he would tame Médéah in the space of six months.
      You understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the
      time named, he would not only lose his bet, but people would say he was
      afraid; and a brave captain of Spahis cannot risk this, even to gratify a
      pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred obligations
      in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see my position, madame,” said Morrel, bestowing a
      grateful smile on Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems to me,” said Danglars, in his coarse tone,
      ill-concealed by a forced smile, “that you have already got horses
      enough.” Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass
      unnoticed, but, to the surprise of the young people, she pretended not to
      hear it, and said nothing. Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility,
      and showed her two immense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants,
      of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce. The baroness was
      astonished. “Why,” said she, “you could plant one of the
      chestnut-trees in the Tuileries inside! How can such enormous jars have
      been manufactured?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “you must not ask of
      us, the manufacturers of fine porcelain, such a question. It is the work
      of another age, constructed by the genii of earth and water.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?—at what period can that have been?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an
      oven built expressly, and that in this oven twelve jars like this were
      successively baked. Two broke, from the heat of the fire; the other ten
      were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea. The sea, knowing what
      was required of her, threw over them her weeds, encircled them with coral,
      and encrusted them with shells; the whole was cemented by two hundred
      years beneath these almost impervious depths, for a revolution carried
      away the emperor who wished to make the trial, and only left the documents
      proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea. At the
      end of two hundred years the documents were found, and they thought of
      bringing up the jars. Divers descended in machines, made expressly on the
      discovery, into the bay where they were thrown; but of ten three only
      remained, the rest having been broken by the waves. I am fond of these
      jars, upon which, perhaps, misshapen, frightful monsters have fixed their
      cold, dull eyes, and in which myriads of small fish have slept, seeking a
      refuge from the pursuit of their enemies.” Meanwhile, Danglars, who
      had cared little for curiosities, was mechanically tearing off the
      blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one after another. When he had
      finished with the orange-tree, he began at the cactus; but this, not being
      so easily plucked as the orange-tree, pricked him dreadfully. He
      shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Monte Cristo to him, “I do not recommend my
      pictures to you, who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless,
      here are two by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a
      Raphael, a Van Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth
      looking at.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stay,” said Debray; “I recognize this Hobbema.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which, I believe, does not contain one?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; and yet they refused to buy it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?” said Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You pretend not to know,—because government was not rich
      enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, pardon me,” said Château-Renaud; “I have heard of
      these things every day during the last eight years, and I cannot
      understand them yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will, by and by,” said Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think not,” replied Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,”
      announced Baptistin. A black satin stock, fresh from the maker’s
      hands, gray moustaches, a bold eye, a major’s uniform, ornamented
      with three medals and five crosses—in fact, the thorough bearing of
      an old soldier—such was the appearance of Major Bartolomeo
      Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom we are already acquainted. Close
      to him, dressed in entirely new clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea
      Cavalcanti, the dutiful son, whom we also know. The three young people
      were talking together. On the entrance of the new-comers, their eyes
      glanced from father to son, and then, naturally enough, rested on the
      latter, whom they began criticising. “Cavalcanti!” said
      Debray. “A fine name,” said Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Château-Renaud, “these Italians are well
      named and badly dressed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are fastidious, Château-Renaud,” replied Debray; “those
      clothes are well cut and quite new.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is just what I find fault with. That gentleman appears to be
      well dressed for the first time in his life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are those gentlemen?” asked Danglars of Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You heard—Cavalcanti.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That tells me their name, and nothing else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true. You do not know the Italian nobility; the Cavalcanti are
      all descended from princes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have they any fortune?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An enormous one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do they do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Try to spend it all. They have some business with you, I think,
      from what they told me the day before yesterday. I, indeed, invited them
      here today on your account. I will introduce you to them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent,”
      said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The son has been educated in a college in the south; I believe near
      Marseilles. You will find him quite enthusiastic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon what subject?” asked Madame Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The French ladies, madame. He has made up his mind to take a wife
      from Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A fine idea that of his,” said Danglars, shrugging his
      shoulders. Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which,
      at any other time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time
      she controlled herself. “The baron appears thoughtful today,”
      said Monte Cristo to her; “are they going to put him in the
      ministry?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not yet, I think. More likely he has been speculating on the
      Bourse, and has lost money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. and Madame de Villefort,” cried Baptistin. They entered.
      M. de Villefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was visibly affected,
      and when Monte Cristo touched his hand, he felt it tremble. “Certainly,
      women alone know how to dissimulate,” said Monte Cristo to himself,
      glancing at Madame Danglars, who was smiling on the procureur, and
      embracing his wife. After a short time, the count saw Bertuccio, who,
      until then, had been occupied on the other side of the house, glide into
      an adjoining room. He went to him. “What do you want, M. Bertuccio?”
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your excellency has not stated the number of guests.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, true.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How many covers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count for yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is everyone here, your excellency?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar. The count watched him.
      “Good heavens!” he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the matter?” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That woman—that woman!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The one with a white dress and so many diamonds—the fair one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whom do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The woman of the garden!—she that was <i>enciente</i>—she
      who was walking while she waited for——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes starting and his hair on
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Waiting for whom?” Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to
      Villefort with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo.
      “Oh, oh,” he at length muttered, “do you see?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Him!—M. de Villefort, the king’s attorney? Certainly I
      see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I did not kill him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, I think you are going mad, good Bertuccio,” said the
      count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then he is not dead?”

    <p>
      “Eight!” repeated Bertuccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop! You are in a shocking hurry to be off—you forget one of
      my guests. Lean a little to the left. Stay! look at M. Andrea Cavalcanti,
      the young man in a black coat, looking at Murillo’s ‘Madonna’;
      now he is turning.” This time Bertuccio would have uttered an
      exclamation, had not a look from Monte Cristo silenced him. “Benedetto?”
      he muttered; “fatality!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Half-past six o’clock has just struck, M. Bertuccio,”
      said the count severely; “I ordered dinner at that hour, and I do
      not like to wait;” and he returned to his guests, while Bertuccio,
      leaning against the wall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. Five
      minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and
      Bertuccio appearing said, with a violent effort, “The dinner waits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort. “M.
      de Villefort,” he said, “will you conduct the Baroness
      Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.

      Chapter 63. The Dinner
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was evident that
      one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining-room. Each
      one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house, and yet
      astonished, even uneasy though they were, they still felt that they would
      not like to be absent. The recent events, the solitary and eccentric
      position of the count, his enormous, nay, almost incredible fortune,
      should have made men cautious, and have altogether prevented ladies
      visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them;
      and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of
      prudence and decorum. And all present, even including Cavalcanti and his
      son, notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the
      other, were thoughtful, on finding themselves assembled at the house of
      this incomprehensible man. Madame Danglars had started when Villefort, on
      the count’s invitation, offered his arm; and Villefort felt that his
      glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles, when he felt the arm of the
      baroness press upon his own. None of this had escaped the count, and even
      by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired
      considerable interest for an observer. M. de Villefort had on the right
      hand Madame Danglars, on his left Morrel. The count was seated between
      Madame de Villefort and Danglars; the other seats were filled by Debray,
      who was placed between the two Cavalcanti, and by Château-Renaud, seated
      between Madame de Villefort and Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to
      overturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the
      appetite of his guests. It was an Oriental feast that he offered to them,
      but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare.
      Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide
      was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan. Rare birds, retaining
      their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread upon massive silver
      dishes, together with every wine produced in the Archipelago, Asia Minor,
      or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose grotesque shape seemed to give an
      additional flavor to the draught,—all these, like one of the
      displays with which Apicius of old gratified his guests, passed in review
      before the eyes of the astonished Parisians, who understood that it was
      possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons, but
      only on the condition of eating pearls, like Cleopatra, or drinking
      refined gold, like Lorenzo de’ Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment, and began laughing and
      joking about it. “Gentlemen,” he said, “you will admit
      that, when arrived at a certain degree of fortune, the superfluities of
      life are all that can be desired; and the ladies will allow that, after
      having risen to a certain eminence of position, the ideal alone can be
      more exalted. Now, to follow out this reasoning, what is the marvellous?—that
      which we do not understand. What is it that we really desire?—that
      which we cannot obtain. Now, to see things which I cannot understand, to
      procure impossibilities, these are the study of my life. I gratify my
      wishes by two means—my will and my money. I take as much interest in
      the pursuit of some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in promoting a new
      railway line; you, M. de Villefort, in condemning a culprit to death; you,
      M. Debray, in pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de Château-Renaud, in pleasing
      a woman; and you, Morrel, in breaking a horse that no one can ride. For
      example, you see these two fish; one brought from fifty leagues beyond St.
      Petersburg, the other five leagues from Naples. Is it not amusing to see
      them both on the same table?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are the two fish?” asked Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Château-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name
      of one, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of
      the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This one is, I think, a sterlet,” said Château-Renaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just so. Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are
      caught.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sterlets,” said Château-Renaud, “are only found in the
      Volga.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And,” said Cavalcanti, “I know that Lake Fusaro alone
      supplies lampreys of that size.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible!” cried all the guests simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, this is just what amuses me,” said Monte Cristo.
      “I am like Nero—<i>cupitor impossibilium</i>; and that is what
      is amusing you at this moment. This fish, which seems so exquisite to you,
      is very likely no better than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to
      procure it, and here it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how could you have these fish brought to France?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, nothing more easy. Each fish was brought over in a cask—one
      filled with river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants;
      they were placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived
      twelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized
      them, killing one with milk and the other with wine. You do not believe
      me, M. Danglars!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot help doubting,” answered Danglars with his stupid
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Baptistin,” said the count, “have the other fish
      brought in—the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other
      casks, and which are yet alive.” Danglars opened his bewildered
      eyes; the company clapped their hands. Four servants carried in two casks
      covered with aquatic plants, and in each of which was breathing a fish
      similar to those on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why have two of each sort?” asked Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Merely because one might have died,” carelessly answered
      Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are certainly an extraordinary man,” said Danglars;
      “and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And to have ideas,” added Madame Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the
      Romans, who much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves
      from Ostia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the <i>mulus</i>,
      and which, from the description, must probably be the goldfish. It was
      also considered a luxury to have them alive, it being an amusing sight to
      see them die, for, when dying, they change color three or four times, and
      like the rainbow when it disappears, pass through all the prismatic
      shades, after which they were sent to the kitchen. Their agony formed part
      of their merit—if they were not seen alive, they were despised when
      dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Debray, “but then Ostia is only a few
      leagues from Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said Monte Cristo; “but what would be the use of
      living eighteen hundred years after Lucullus, if we can do no better than
      he could?” The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had
      the good sense not to say anything. “All this is very extraordinary,”
      said Château-Renaud; “still, what I admire the most, I confess, is
      the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed. Is it not
      true that you only bought this house five or six days ago?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly not longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week. If I
      remember rightly, it had another entrance, and the courtyard was paved and
      empty; while today we have a splendid lawn, bordered by trees which appear
      to be a hundred years old.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not? I am fond of grass and shade,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Madame de Villefort, “the door was towards
      the road before, and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me
      into the house from the road, I remember.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, madame,” said Monte Cristo; “but I preferred
      having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over
      my gate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In four days,” said Morrel; “it is extraordinary!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed,” said Château-Renaud, “it seems quite
      miraculous to make a new house out of an old one; for it was very old, and
      dull too. I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when M. de
      Saint-Méran advertised it for sale two or three years ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Saint-Méran?” said Madame de Villefort; “then
      this house belonged to M. de Saint-Méran before you bought it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It appears so,” replied Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied,”
      said Château-Renaud, “and it was quite melancholy to look at it,
      with the blinds closed, the doors locked, and the weeds in the court.
      Really, if the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the
      procureur, one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible
      crime had been committed.” Villefort, who had hitherto not tasted
      the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him, here
      took one, and drank it off. Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse,
      and then said, “It is singular, baron, but the same idea came across
      me the first time I came here; it looked so gloomy I should never have
      bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands.
      Perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is probable,” stammered out Villefort, trying to smile;
      “but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such
      proceeding. This house is part of Valentine’s marriage-portion, and
      M. de Saint-Méran wished to sell it; for if it had remained another year
      or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin.” It was Morrel’s
      turn to become pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There was, above all, one room,” continued Monte Cristo,
      “very plain in appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not
      why, appeared to me quite dramatic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?” said Danglars; “why dramatic?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can we account for instinct?” said Monte Cristo. “Are
      there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness?—why, we
      cannot tell. It is a chain of recollections—an idea which carries
      you back to other times, to other places—which, very likely, have no
      connection with the present time and place. And there is something in this
      room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges
      [*] or Desdemona. Stay, since we have finished dinner, I will show it to
      you, and then we will take coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play.”
      Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort rose,
      Monte Cristo did the same, and the rest followed their example. Villefort
      and Madame Danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to their seats;
      they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you hear?” said Madame Danglars.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * Elisabeth de Rossan, Marquise de Ganges, was one of the
     famous women of the court of Louis XIV. where she was known
     as “La Belle Provençale.” She was the widow of the Marquise
     de Castellane when she married de Ganges, and having the
     misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers-in-law,
     was forced by them to take poison; and they finished her off
     with pistol and dagger.—Ed.
</pre>
    <p>
      “We must go,” replied Villefort, offering his arm. The others,
      attracted by curiosity, were already scattered in different parts of the
      house; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room,
      and that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of the rest of the
      building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace. Each one went out by
      the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained; then, when
      they had passed, he brought up the rear, and on his face was a smile,
      which, if they could have understood it, would have alarmed them much more
      than a visit to the room they were about to enter. They began by walking
      through the apartments, many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style,
      with cushions and divans instead of beds, and pipes instead of furniture.
      The drawing-rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old
      masters, the boudoirs hung with draperies from China, of fanciful colors,
      fantastic design, and wonderful texture. At length they arrived at the
      famous room. There was nothing particular about it, excepting that,
      although daylight had disappeared, it was not lighted, and everything in
      it was old-fashioned, while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated.
      These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh.” cried Madame de Villefort, “it is really
      frightful.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not heard. Many
      observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous opinion that
      there was something sinister about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it not so?” asked Monte Cristo. “Look at that large
      clumsy bed, hung with such gloomy, blood-colored drapery! And those two
      crayon portraits, that have faded from the dampness; do they not seem to
      say, with their pale lips and staring eyes, ‘We have seen’?”
      Villefort became livid; Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed near
      the chimney. “Oh,” said Madame de Villefort, smiling, “are
      you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which
      the crime was committed?” Madame Danglars rose suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then,” said Monte Cristo, “this is not all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is there more?” said Debray, who had not failed to
      notice the agitation of Madame Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, what else is there?” said Danglars; “for, at
      present, I cannot say that I have seen anything extraordinary. What do you
      say, M. Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said he, “we have at Pisa, Ugolino’s tower;
      at Ferrara, Tasso’s prison; at Rimini, the room of Francesca and
      Paolo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but you have not this little staircase,” said Monte
      Cristo, opening a door concealed by the drapery. “Look at it, and
      tell me what you think of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a wicked-looking, crooked staircase,” said
      Château-Renaud with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but
      certainly everything appears to me black in this house,” said
      Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since Valentine’s dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been
      silent and sad. “Can you imagine,” said Monte Cristo, “some
      Othello or Abbé de Ganges, one stormy, dark night, descending these stairs
      step by step, carrying a load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of
      man, if not from God?” Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of
      Villefort, who was obliged to support himself against the wall. “Ah,
      madame,” cried Debray, “what is the matter with you? how pale
      you look!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very evident what is the matter with her,” said Madame
      de Villefort; “M. de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to
      us, doubtless intending to frighten us to death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Villefort, “really, count, you frighten the
      ladies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the matter?” asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame
      Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing,” she replied with a violent effort. “I want
      air, that is all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you come into the garden?” said Debray, advancing
      towards the back staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” she answered, “I would rather remain here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you really frightened, madame?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, sir,” said Madame Danglars; “but you suppose
      scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality.”
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes,” said Monte Cristo smiling; “it is all a
      matter of imagination. Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an
      honest mother? And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the
      goddess Lucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which,
      not to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father
      carrying the sleeping child?” Here Madame Danglars, instead of being
      calmed by the soft picture, uttered a groan and fainted. “Madame
      Danglars is ill,” said Villefort; “it would be better to take
      her to her carriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i>” said Monte Cristo, “and I have
      forgotten my smelling-bottle!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have mine,” said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over
      to Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good
      properties the count had tested on Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” she said, “at your advice I have made the trial.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have you succeeded?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo dropped
      a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she returned to
      consciousness. “Ah,” she cried, “what a frightful dream!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They looked
      for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in poetical
      ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major Cavalcanti
      on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte Cristo seemed in
      despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and conducted her into the
      garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalcanti.
      “Really, madame,” he said, “did I alarm you much?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, sir,” she answered; “but you know, things
      impress us differently, according to the mood of our minds.”
      Villefort forced a laugh. “And then, you know,” he said,
      “an idea, a supposition, is sufficient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Monte Cristo, “you may believe me if you
      like, but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take care,” said Madame de Villefort, “the king’s
      attorney is here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” replied Monte Cristo, “since that is the case, I
      will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your declaration?” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, before witnesses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, this is very interesting,” said Debray; “if there
      really has been a crime, we will investigate it.”
    </p>

      “There has been a crime,” said Monte Cristo. “Come this
      way, gentlemen; come, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available,
      should be made before the competent authorities.” He then took
      Villefort’s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of Madame
      Danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the plantain-tree,
      where the shade was thickest. All the other guests followed. “Stay,”
      said Monte Cristo, “here, in this very spot” (and he stamped
      upon the ground), “I had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in, to
      refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging, found a box, or rather,
      the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly
      born infant.” Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen,
      while that of Villefort trembled. “A newly born infant,”
      repeated Debray; “this affair becomes serious!”

      “Well,” said Château-Renaud, “I was not wrong just now
      then, when I said that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their
      exteriors carried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy
      because it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who said it was a crime?” asked Villefort, with a last
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?”
      cried Monte Cristo. “And pray what do you call such an action?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But who said it was buried alive?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a
      cemetery.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is done to infanticides in this country?” asked Major
      Cavalcanti innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, their heads are soon cut off,” said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed?” said Cavalcanti.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?” asked Monte
      Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, count,” replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely
      human.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this
      scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far, said,
      “Come, gentlemen,—some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,”
      and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, count,” said Madame Danglars, “I am ashamed to
      own it, but all your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg
      you to let me sit down;” and she fell into a chair. Monte Cristo
      bowed, and went to Madame de Villefort. “I think Madame Danglars
      again requires your bottle,” he said. But before Madame de Villefort
      could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame
      Danglars, “I must speak to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In my office, or in the court, if you like,—that is the
      surest place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Madame de Villefort approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, my dear friend,” said Madame Danglars, trying to
      smile; “it is over now, and I am much better.”

      Chapter 64. The Beggar
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he evening passed
      on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris, which
      Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the uneasiness she
      experienced. On his wife’s request, M. de Villefort was the first to
      give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his landau to Madame
      Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife. As for M.
      Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M. Cavalcanti, he
      paid no attention to anything that was passing. While Monte Cristo had
      begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he had noticed the
      approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon guessed all that had
      passed between them, though the words had been uttered in so low a voice
      as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars. Without opposing their
      arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Château-Renaud, and Debray to leave on
      horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort’s carriage. Danglars,
      more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had offered him a seat in
      his carriage. Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door; the
      groom, in every respect a caricature of the English fashion, was standing
      on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad,
      and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people, amongst
      whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king’s attorney. Then he had
      been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the stiff-necked
      old major and his modest son, and taking into consideration the
      hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the society of
      some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of his heir. He
      contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the
      major’s little finger; for the major, like a prudent man, in case of
      any accident happening to his bank-notes, had immediately converted them
      into an available asset. Then, after dinner, on the pretext of business,
      he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living; and the father
      and son, previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to
      receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually, were so
      full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker’s
      servants, so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself
      upon. One thing above all the rest heightened the respect, nay almost the
      veneration, of Danglars for Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to the
      principle of Horace, <i>nil admirari</i>, had contented himself with
      showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were
      caught. Then he had eaten some without saying a word more; Danglars,
      therefore, concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the
      illustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed
      upon trout brought from Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by
      the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro,
      and the sterlet from the Volga. Thus it was with much politeness of manner
      that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words, “Tomorrow, sir, I
      shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I, sir,” said Danglars, “shall be most happy to
      receive you.” Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his
      carriage to the Hôtel des Princes, if it would not be depriving him of the
      company of his son. To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some
      time past his son had lived independently of him, that he had his own
      horses and carriages, and that not having come together, it would not be
      difficult for them to leave separately. The major seated himself,
      therefore, by the side of Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the
      ideas of order and economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able
      to allow his son 60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a
      fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom, who,
      instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had taken it to
      the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to
      reach it. The groom heard him with humility, took the bit of the impatient
      animal with his left hand, and with the right held out the reins to
      Andrea, who, taking them from him, rested his polished boot lightly on the
      step. At that moment a hand touched his shoulder. The young man turned
      round, thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they
      wished to tell him, and had returned just as they were starting. But
      instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a strange face, sunburnt,
      and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as carbuncles, and a smile
      upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth, pointed and
      sharp as the wolf’s or jackal’s. A red handkerchief encircled
      his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs,
      which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they would rattle as he
      walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man’s
      shoulder, and which was the first thing Andrea saw, seemed of gigantic
      size. Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in
      his tilbury, or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his
      interrogator? We cannot say; but only relate the fact that he shuddered
      and stepped back suddenly. “What do you want of me?” he asked.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,” said the man with
      the red handkerchief, “but I want to speak to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have no right to beg at night,” said the groom,
      endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not begging, my fine fellow,” said the unknown to the
      servant, with so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a
      smile, that he withdrew; “I only wish to say two or three words to
      your master, who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said Andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not
      to perceive his agitation, “what do you want? Speak quickly, friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The man said, in a low voice: “I wish—I wish you to spare me
      the walk back to Paris. I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a
      dinner as you, I can scarcely stand.” The young man shuddered at
      this strange familiarity. “Tell me,” he said—“tell
      me what you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and
      carry me back.” Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and
      looking impudently at the youth; “I have taken the whim into my
      head; do you understand, Master Benedetto?”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went
      towards his groom, saying, “This man is right; I did indeed charge
      him with a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the
      barrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late.” The
      surprised groom retired. “Let me at least reach a shady spot,”
      said Andrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, as for that, I’ll take you to a splendid place,”
      said the man with the handkerchief; and taking the horse’s bit he
      led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness
      the honor that Andrea conferred upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage,”
      said he; “oh, no, it’s only because I am tired, and also
      because I have a little business to talk over with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, step in,” said the young man. It was a pity this scene
      had not occurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal
      throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant
      driver of the tilbury. Andrea drove past the last house in the village
      without saying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though
      well-pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle. Once
      out of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself that he
      could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse and crossing
      his arms before the man, he asked,—“Now, tell me why you come
      to disturb my tranquillity?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me ask you why you deceived me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How have I deceived you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘How,’ do you ask? When we parted at the Pont du Var,
      you told me you were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but
      instead of that, you come to Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How does that annoy you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It does not; on the contrary, I think it will answer my purpose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So,” said Andrea, “you are speculating upon me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What fine words he uses!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well, don’t be angry, my boy; you know well enough what
      it is to be unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous. I thought you
      were earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as <i>facchino</i>
      or <i>cicerone</i>, and I pitied you sincerely, as I would a child of my
      own. You know I always did call you my child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come, what then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Patience—patience!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am patient, but go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom, a
      tilbury, and fine new clothes. You must have discovered a mine, or else
      become a stockbroker.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that, as you confess, you are jealous?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I am pleased—so pleased that I wished to congratulate
      you; but as I am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that
      I might not compromise you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!” exclaimed
      Andrea; “you speak to me before my servant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can I help that, my boy? I speak to you when I can catch you.
      You have a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as
      an eel; if I had missed you tonight, I might not have had another chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see, I do not conceal myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are lucky; I wish I could say as much, for I do conceal myself;
      and then I was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,”
      added Caderousse with his unpleasant smile. “It was very polite of
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said Andrea, “what do you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend,
      that is not right—take care, or I may become troublesome.”
      This menace smothered the young man’s passion. He urged the horse
      again into a trot. “You should not speak so to an old friend like
      me, Caderousse, as you said just now; you are a native of Marseilles, I am——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know then now what you are?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I
      am young and wilful. Between people like us threats are out of place,
      everything should be amicably arranged. Is it my fault if fortune, which
      has frowned on you, has been kind to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fortune has been kind to you, then? Your tilbury, your groom, your
      clothes, are not then hired? Good, so much the better,” said
      Caderousse, his eyes sparkling with avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me,” said
      Andrea, becoming more and more excited. “If I had been wearing a
      handkerchief like yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on
      my feet, you would not have known me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my
      being as well-dressed as anyone, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your
      heart. If you have two coats you will give me one of them. I used to
      divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said Andrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What an appetite you used to have! Is it as good now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” replied Andrea, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have
      just left?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is not a prince; simply a count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A count, and a rich one too, eh?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is
      not a very good-tempered gentleman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, be easy! I have no design upon your count, and you shall have
      him all to yourself. But,” said Caderousse, again smiling with the
      disagreeable expression he had before assumed, “you must pay for it—you
      understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what do you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think that with a hundred francs a month——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I could live——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon a hundred francs!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come—you understand me; but that with——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here are two hundred,” said Andrea; and he placed ten gold
      louis in the hand of Caderousse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good!” said Caderousse.

      “Ah, true. Well; I shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear
      a decent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a café.
      Then, in the evening, I shall go to the theatre; I shall look like some
      retired baker. That is what I want.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be
      steady, nothing could be better.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think so, M. Bossuet? And you—what will you become? A
      peer of France?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Andrea, “who knows?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Major Cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank
      is abolished.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No politics, Caderousse. And now that you have all you want, and
      that we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all, my good friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How? Not at all?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my
      head, with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my
      pocket, without reckoning what was there before—making in all about
      two hundred francs,—why, I should certainly be arrested at the
      barriers. Then, to justify myself, I should say that you gave me the
      money; this would cause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon
      without giving due notice, and I should then be escorted back to the
      shores of the Mediterranean. Then I should become simply No. 106, and
      good-bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker! No, no, my boy; I
      prefer remaining honorably in the capital.” Andrea scowled.
      Certainly, as he had himself owned, the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti
      was a wilful fellow. He drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around
      him, and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket, where it began
      playing with a pistol. But, meanwhile, Caderousse, who had never taken his
      eyes off his companion, passed his hand behind his back, and opened a long
      Spanish knife, which he always carried with him, to be ready in case of
      need. The two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one
      another. Andrea’s hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was
      carried up to the red moustache, which it played with for some time.
      “Good Caderousse,” he said, “how happy you will be.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do my best,” said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard,
      shutting up his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through
      the barrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in
      more danger riding than on foot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait,” said Caderousse, “we shall see.” He then
      took the great-coat with the large collar, which the groom had left behind
      in the tilbury, and put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti’s
      hat, which he placed upon his own head, and finally he assumed the
      careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, tell me,” said Andrea, “am I to remain bareheaded?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pooh,” said Caderousse; “it is so windy that your hat
      can easily appear to have blown off.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come; enough of this,” said Cavalcanti.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you waiting for?” said Caderousse. “I hope I
      am not the cause.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush,” said Andrea. They passed the barrier without accident.
      At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse leaped
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well!” said Andrea,—“my servant’s coat and
      my hat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Caderousse, “you would not like me to risk
      taking cold?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what am I to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You? Oh, you are young while I am beginning to get old. <i>Au
      revoir</i>, Benedetto;” and running into a court, he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” said Andrea, sighing, “one cannot be completely
      happy in this world!”

      Chapter 65. A Conjugal Scene
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the Place Louis
      XV. the three young people separated—that is to say, Morrel went to
      the Boulevards, Château-Renaud to the Pont de la Révolution, and Debray to
      the Quai. Most probably Morrel and Château-Renaud returned to their
      “domestic hearths,” as they say in the gallery of the Chamber
      in well-turned speeches, and in the theatre of the Rue Richelieu in
      well-written pieces; but it was not the case with Debray. When he reached
      the wicket of the Louvre, he turned to the left, galloped across the
      Carrousel, passed through the Rue Saint-Roch, and, issuing from the Rue de
      la Michodière, he arrived at M. Danglars’ door just at the same time
      that Villefort’s landau, after having deposited him and his wife at
      the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, stopped to leave the baroness at her own house.
      Debray, with the air of a man familiar with the house, entered first into
      the court, threw his bridle into the hands of a footman, and returned to
      the door to receive Madame Danglars, to whom he offered his arm, to
      conduct her to her apartments. The gate once closed, and Debray and the
      baroness alone in the court, he asked,—“What was the matter
      with you, Hermine? and why were you so affected at that story, or rather
      fable, which the count related?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my
      friend,” said the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Hermine,” replied Debray; “you cannot make me
      believe that; on the contrary, you were in excellent spirits when you
      arrived at the count’s. M. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but
      I know how much you care for his ill-humor. Someone has vexed you; I will
      allow no one to annoy you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are deceived, Lucien, I assure you,” replied Madame
      Danglars; “and what I have told you is really the case, added to the
      ill-humor you remarked, but which I did not think it worth while to allude
      to.” It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that
      nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to
      themselves; or that, as Debray had guessed, she had experienced some
      secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone. Being a man who
      knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties
      of womanhood, he did not then press his inquiries, but waited for a more
      appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her, or receive
      an avowal <i>proprio motu</i>. At the door of her apartment the baroness
      met Mademoiselle Cornélie, her confidential maid. “What is my
      daughter doing?” asked Madame Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She practiced all the evening, and then went to bed,” replied
      Mademoiselle Cornélie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yet I think I hear her piano.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly, who is playing while
      Mademoiselle Danglars is in bed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Madame Danglars, “come and undress me.”
      They entered the bedroom. Debray stretched himself upon a large couch, and
      Madame Danglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle Cornélie.
      “My dear M. Lucien,” said Madame Danglars through the door,
      “you are always complaining that Eugénie will not address a word to
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” said Lucien, playing with a little dog, who,
      recognizing him as a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, “I
      am not the only one who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf
      say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said Madame Danglars; “yet I think this will all
      pass off, and that you will one day see her enter your study.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My study?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least that of the minister.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To ask for an engagement at the Opera. Really, I never saw such an
      infatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion.”
      Debray smiled. “Well,” said he, “let her come, with your
      consent and that of the baron, and we will try and give her an engagement,
      though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, Cornélie,” said Madame Danglars, “I do not require
      you any longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornélie obeyed, and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a
      charming loose dress, and came and sat down close to Debray. Then she
      began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. Lucien looked at her for
      a moment in silence. “Come, Hermine,” he said, after a short
      time, “answer candidly,—something vexes you—is it not
      so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing,” answered the baroness.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      And yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards a
      looking-glass. “I am frightful tonight,” she said. Debray
      rose, smiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter
      point, when the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray
      reseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round,
      and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to
      conceal. “Good-evening, madame,” said the banker; “good-evening,
      M. Debray.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to
      make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming a
      dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her husband.
      “Read me something, M. Debray,” she said. Debray, who was
      slightly disturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the
      calmness of the baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl
      knife inlaid with gold. “Excuse me,” said the banker, “but
      you will tire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and M. Debray lives
      some distance from here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Debray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and
      politely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness
      there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife
      might wish to do. The baroness was also surprised, and showed her
      astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her
      husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where he was
      looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was, that the
      proud look entirely failed of its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Lucien,” said the baroness, “I assure you I have no
      desire to sleep, and that I have a thousand things to tell you this
      evening, which you must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am at your service, madame,” replied Lucien coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear M. Debray,” said the banker, “do not kill
      yourself tonight listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can
      hear them as well tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you
      will allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.” This
      time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien and the
      baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their eyes,
      as if to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible will of
      the master of the house prevailed, and the husband was victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,”
      continued Danglars; “oh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence
      forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so
      rarely I make such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.”
      Debray muttered something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against
      the edge of the door, like Nathan in <i>Athalie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is extraordinary,” he said, when the door was closed
      behind him, “how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an
      advantage over us.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Lucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the open
      book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he began
      playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as Debray,
      and attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck
      and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room. The animal
      uttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its destination, it
      crouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such unusual treatment
      remained silent and motionless. “Do you know, sir,” asked the
      baroness, “that you are improving? Generally you are only rude, but
      tonight you are brutal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is because I am in a worse humor than usual,” replied
      Danglars. Hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain. These glances
      frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars, but this evening he took no
      notice of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what have I to do with your ill-humor?” said the
      baroness, irritated at the impassibility of her husband; “do these
      things concern me? Keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes, or,
      since you have clerks whom you pay, vent it upon them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not so,” replied Danglars; “your advice is wrong, so I
      shall not follow it. My money boxes are my Pactolus, as, I think, M.
      Demoustier says, and I will not retard its course, or disturb its calm. My
      clerks are honest men, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their
      deserts, if I may value them according to what they bring in; therefore I
      shall not get into a passion with them; those with whom I will be in a
      passion are those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my
      fortune.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune? Explain
      yourself more clearly, I beg, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, make yourself easy!—I am not speaking riddles, and you
      will soon know what I mean. The people who exhaust my fortune are those
      who draw out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand you, sir,” said the baroness, trying to
      disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face. “You
      understand me perfectly, on the contrary,” said Danglars: “but,
      if you will persist, I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs
      upon the Spanish loan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And pray,” asked the baroness, “am I responsible for
      this loss?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly it is not mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Once for all, sir,” replied the baroness sharply, “I
      tell you I will not hear cash named; it is a style of language I never
      heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the
      bank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that noise
      of jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and re-counted, is
      odious to me. I only know one thing I dislike more, which is the sound of
      your voice.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Really?” said Danglars. “Well, this surprises me, for I
      thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I? What could put such an idea into your head?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah?—what next?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most assuredly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should like to know upon what occasion?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i> that is very easily done. Last February you
      were the first who told me of the Haitian funds. You had dreamed that a
      ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre, that this ship brought news that
      a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made. I know how
      clear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as many
      shares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs by it,
      of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you. You spent it as you
      pleased; that was your business. In March there was a question about a
      grant to a railway. Three companies presented themselves, each offering
      equal securities. You told me that your instinct,—and although you
      pretend to know nothing about speculations, I think on the contrary, that
      your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs,—well, you
      told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to
      the company called the Southern. I bought two thirds of the shares of that
      company; as you had foreseen, the shares trebled in value, and I picked up
      a million, from which 250,000 francs were paid to you for pin-money. How
      have you spent this 250,000 francs?—it is no business of mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When are you coming to the point?” cried the baroness,
      shivering with anger and impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Patience, madame, I am coming to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s fortunate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In April you went to dine at the minister’s. You heard a
      private conversation respecting Spanish affairs—on the expulsion of
      Don Carlos. I bought some Spanish shares. The expulsion took place and I
      pocketed 600,000 francs the day Charles V. repassed the Bidassoa. Of these
      600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns. They were yours, you disposed of
      them according to your fancy, and I asked no questions; but it is not the
      less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, and what then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, your manner of speaking——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It expresses my meaning, and that is all I want. Well, three days
      after that you talked politics with M. Debray, and you fancied from his
      words that Don Carlos had returned to Spain. Well, I sold my shares, the
      news got out, and I no longer sold—I gave them away, next day I find
      the news was false, and by this false report I have lost 700,000 francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a
      fourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debray’s name
      is mixed up in this affair.”

      must have lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends.”

      “For shame!” exclaimed the baroness.

      “Oh, let us have no gestures, no screams, no modern drama, or you
      will oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here, pocketing the
      whole of the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year, while
      he smiles to himself, saying that he has found what the most skilful
      players have never discovered—that is, a roulette where he wins
      without playing, and is no loser when he loses.” The baroness became
      enraged. “Wretch!” she cried, “will you dare to tell me
      you did not know what you now reproach me with?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not say that I did know it, and I do not say that I did not
      know it. I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four
      years that we have ceased to be husband and wife, and see whether it has
      not always been consistent. Some time after our rupture, you wished to
      study music, under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful
      appearance at the Théâtre Italien; at the same time I felt inclined to
      learn dancing of the <i>danseuse</i> who acquired such a reputation in
      London. This cost me, on your account and mine, 100,000 francs. I said
      nothing, for we must have peace in the house; and 100,000 francs for a
      lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not
      too much. Well, you soon become tired of singing, and you take a fancy to
      study diplomacy with the minister’s secretary. You understand, it
      signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your
      own cash box. But today I find you are drawing on mine, and that your
      apprenticeship may cost me 700,000 francs per month. Stop there, madame,
      for this cannot last. Either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis,
      and I will tolerate him, or he must never set his foot again in my house;—do
      you understand, madame?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, this is too much,” cried Hermine, choking, “you are
      worse than despicable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” continued Danglars, “I find you did not even
      pause there——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Insults!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly. I
      have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me in
      the same way. You say you have nothing to do with my cash box. Be it so.
      Do as you like with your own, but do not fill or empty mine. Besides, how
      do I know that this was not a political trick, that the minister enraged
      at seeing me in the opposition, and jealous of the popular sympathy I
      excite, has not concerted with M. Debray to ruin me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A probable thing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?—a
      false telegraphic despatch—it is almost impossible for wrong signals
      to be made as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose
      for me—I am sure of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said the baroness humbly, “are you not aware that
      the man employed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law
      with him, that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would
      have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which proves
      that he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a
      sleepless night, which has caused the minister’s secretaries to
      blacken several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, sir,” said Hermine suddenly, “if all this is, as
      you say, caused by M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you
      come and tell me of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do I know M. Debray?—do I wish to know him?—do I wish
      to know that he gives advice?—do I wish to follow it?—do I
      speculate? No; you do all this, not I.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still it seems to me, that as you profit by it——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars shrugged his shoulders. “Foolish creature,” he
      exclaimed. “Women fancy they have talent because they have managed
      two or three intrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if
      you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the
      commencement of the art—for generally husbands <i>will</i> not see—you
      would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among
      the women of the world. But it has not been so with me,—I see, and
      always have seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have
      hidden a thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped
      me, while you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed
      you had deceived me. What has been the result?—that, thanks to my
      pretended ignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort
      to M. Debray, who has not trembled before me. There is not one who has not
      treated me as the master of the house,—the only title I desire with
      respect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to speak
      of me as I have spoken of them this day. I will allow you to make me
      hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above all,
      I forbid you to ruin me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had
      been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if touched by a
      spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition; she
      then took two or three steps towards her husband, as though to tear the
      secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which he withheld from some
      odious calculation,—odious, as all his calculations were.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Villefort!—What do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a
      philosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was
      nothing to be got out of a king’s attorney, died of grief or anger
      at finding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been <i>enceinte</i>
      six. I am brutal,—I not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one of
      the reasons of my success in commercial business. Why did he kill himself
      instead of you? Because he had no cash to save. My life belongs to my
      cash. M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his share of
      the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become bankrupt for
      the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts do—disappear. He is a
      charming fellow, I allow, when his news is correct; but when it is not,
      there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to reply
      to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of Villefort, of
      the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken
      place in her house during the last few days, and changed the usual calm of
      her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate. Danglars did not even
      look at her, though she did her best to faint. He shut the bedroom door
      after him, without adding another word, and returned to his apartments;
      and when Madame Danglars recovered from her half-fainting condition, she
      could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he day following
      this scene, at the hour the banker usually chose to pay a visit to Madame
      Danglars on his way to his office, his <i>coupé</i> did not appear. At
      this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars ordered her
      carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a curtain, watched the
      departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders that he should be
      informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two o’clock she
      had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove to the Chamber, and
      inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From twelve to two o’clock
      Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his dispatches, and becoming
      more and more sad every minute, heaping figure upon figure, and receiving,
      among other visits, one from Major Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as
      ever, presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before, to
      terminate his business with the banker. On leaving the Chamber, Danglars,
      who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting, and been more
      bitter than ever against the ministry, re-entered his carriage, and told
      the coachman to drive to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No. 30.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged
      Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was
      waiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abbé and
      doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and instead of
      waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments, and
      disappeared. A minute after the door by which the priest had entered
      reopened, and Monte Cristo appeared. “Pardon me,” said he,
      “my dear baron, but one of my friends, the Abbé Busoni, whom you
      perhaps saw pass by, has just arrived in Paris; not having seen him for a
      long time, I could not make up my mind to leave him sooner, so I hope this
      will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay,” said Danglars, “it is my fault; I have chosen my
      visit at a wrong time, and will retire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter with
      you? You look careworn; really, you alarm me. Melancholy in a capitalist,
      like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have been in ill-luck for several days,” said Danglars,
      “and I have heard nothing but bad news.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed?” said Monte Cristo. “Have you had another
      fall at the Bourse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; I am safe for a few days at least. I am only annoyed about a
      bankrupt of Trieste.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really? Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly so. Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I
      don’t know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs
      during the year. Never a mistake or delay—a fellow who paid like a
      prince. Well, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo
      Manfredi suspends payment!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is an unheard-of fatality. I draw upon him for 600,000 francs,
      my bills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of
      exchange signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs, payable at his
      correspondent’s in Paris at the end of this month. Today is the
      30th. I present them; but my correspondent has disappeared. This, with my
      Spanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you really lost by that affair in Spain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash box—nothing more!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, how could you make such a mistake—such an old stager?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is all my wife’s fault. She dreamed Don Carlos had
      returned to Spain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and
      when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen, she assures me. On this
      conviction I allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her
      stockbroker; she speculated and lost. It is true she speculates with her
      own money, not mine; nevertheless, you can understand that when 700,000
      francs leave the wife’s pocket, the husband always finds it out. But
      do you mean to say you have not heard of this? Why, the thing has made a
      tremendous noise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then
      no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse.”

    <p>
      “Then you do not speculate?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?—How could I speculate when I already have so much trouble
      in regulating my income? I should be obliged, besides my steward, to keep
      a clerk and a boy. But touching these Spanish affairs, I think that the
      baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter. The papers said
      something about it, did they not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you believe the papers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?—not the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest
      <i>Messager</i> was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced
      telegraphic despatches.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, that’s what puzzles me,” replied Danglars;
      “the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So that,” said Monte Cristo, “you have lost nearly
      1,700,000 francs this month.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Diable!</i>” said Monte Cristo compassionately, “it
      is a hard blow for a third-rate fortune.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Third-rate,” said Danglars, rather humble, “what do you
      mean by that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly,” continued Monte Cristo, “I make three
      assortments in fortune—first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate
      fortunes. I call those first-rate which are composed of treasures one
      possesses under one’s hand, such as mines, lands, and funded
      property, in such states as France, Austria, and England, provided these
      treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions; I call
      those second-rate fortunes, that are gained by manufacturing enterprises,
      joint-stock companies, viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more
      than 1,500,000 francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty
      millions; finally, I call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of
      a fluctuating capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances
      which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks,
      speculations of the day—in fact, all operations under the influence
      of greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious
      capital of about fifteen millions. I think this is about your position, is
      it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Confound it, yes!” replied Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The result, then, of six more such months as this would be to
      reduce the third-rate house to despair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running
      on!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us imagine seven such months,” continued Monte Cristo, in
      the same tone. “Tell me, have you ever thought that seven times
      1,700,000 francs make nearly twelve millions? No, you have not;—well,
      you are right, for if you indulged in such reflections, you would never
      risk your principal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to
      civilized man. We have our clothes, some more splendid than others,—this
      is our credit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way,
      on retiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of
      about five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are never
      more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive on a
      railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding
      it. Well, out of the five or six millions which form your real capital,
      you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of course, in the same
      degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune; to follow out my
      simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this if repeated three
      or four times will cause death—so pay attention to it, my dear
      Monsieur Danglars. Do you want money? Do you wish me to lend you some?”

    <p>
      “What a bad calculator you are!” exclaimed Danglars, calling
      to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation. “I have made
      money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded. I have made
      up the loss of blood by nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I have been
      defeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some
      galleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good, very good! But the wound remains and will reopen at the
      first loss.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, for I am only embarked in certainties,” replied Danglars,
      with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises; “to involve
      me, three governments must crumble to dust.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, such things have been.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That there should be a famine!”
    </p>

      “Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and
      even then my vessels would become caravans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the better. I congratulate you, my dear M. Danglars,”
      said Monte Cristo; “I see I was deceived, and that you belong to the
      class of second-rate fortunes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think I may aspire to that honor,” said Danglars with a
      smile, which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists
      are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins. “But, while we
      are speaking of business,” Danglars added, pleased to find an
      opportunity of changing the subject, “tell me what I am to do for M.
      Cavalcanti.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation
      seems good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000
      francs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and returned by you to
      me, with your endorsement—of course, I immediately counted him over
      the forty bank-notes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent. “But that is not
      all,” continued Danglars; “he has opened an account with my
      house for his son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “May I ask how much he allows the young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Five thousand francs per month.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sixty thousand francs per year. I thought I was right in believing
      that Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow. How can a young man live upon 5,000
      francs a month?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you understand that if the young man should want a few
      thousands more——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not advance it; the father will never repay it. You do not know
      these ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers. And by whom were
      they recommended to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, by the house of Fenzi, one of the best in Florence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you
      hold to the terms of the agreement.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would you not trust the Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I? oh, I would advance ten millions on his signature. I was only
      speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning just
      now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And with all this, how unassuming he is! I should never have taken
      him for anything more than a mere major.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has
      no manner. The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old
      lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets. But all the Italians
      are the same; they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in
      Oriental splendor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The young man is better,” said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared
      tolerable. I was uneasy about him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into
      the world, as they told me. He has been travelling with a very severe
      tutor, and had never been to Paris before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?”
      asked Danglars carelessly; “they like to unite their fortunes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is usual, certainly; but Cavalcanti is an original who does
      nothing like other people. I cannot help thinking that he has brought his
      son to France to choose a wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sure of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you have heard his fortune mentioned?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions,
      and others that he did not possess a farthing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is your opinion?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal
      impression.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, and it is that——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My opinion is, that all these old <i>podestàs</i>, these ancient <i>condottieri</i>,—for
      the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces,—my
      opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions in corners, the
      secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons, who have
      done the same from generation to generation; and the proof of this is seen
      in their yellow and dry appearance, like the florins of the republic,
      which, from being constantly gazed upon, have become reflected in them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly,” said Danglars, “and this is further
      supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses,
      excepting his palace in Lucca.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, he has a palace?” said Danglars, laughing; “come,
      that is something.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance
      while he lives in a simple house. Oh, as I told you before, I think the
      old fellow is very close.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, you do not flatter him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I scarcely know him; I think I have seen him three times in my
      life; all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself. He was
      telling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant in
      Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in
      France or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that though
      I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is
      a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of
      it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is
      merely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do
      they give them any fortune?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich
      as a gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons
      married according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they married
      against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month. Should
      Andrea marry according to his father’s views, he will, perhaps, give
      him one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were the
      daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the
      father-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the major
      takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would be obliged
      to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling cards or rattling
      the dice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he
      will want a crown, an El Dorado, and Potosí.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently
      marry into plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But
      do you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so
      many questions?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>,” said Danglars, “it would not be a bad
      speculation, I fancy, and you know I am a speculator.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would
      not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Albert,” repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; “ah,
      well; he would care very little about it, I think.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but
      Madame de Morcerf and Albert——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de
      Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle Danglars’ fortune will be great, no doubt,
      especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf
      being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes,” said Danglars, laughing, “it would do her a
      great deal of good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.”
      Monte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,”
      said the count, “you must allow that he has a fine name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So he has; but I like mine as well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they
      have adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that
      according to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility
      which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only
      reckon twenty years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And for this very reason,” said Danglars with a smile, which
      he tried to make sardonic, “I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M.
      Albert de Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the
      Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Morcerfs!—Stay, my dear count,” said Danglars;
      “you are a man of the world, are you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you understand heraldry?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A little.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at
      least, Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “While his name is not Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How?—not Morcerf?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not the least in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made
      himself a count, so that he is not one at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather
      my acquaintance, during the last thirty years. You know I have made the
      most of my arms, though I never forgot my origin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A proof of great humility or great pride,” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, when I was a clerk, Morcerf was a mere fisherman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then he was called——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fernand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only Fernand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fernand Mondego.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are sure?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Pardieu!</i> I have bought enough fish of him to know his name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having
      become noble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there
      have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, nothing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name
      of Fernand Mondego. I have heard that name in Greece.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is the mystery,” said Danglars. “I acknowledge I
      would have given anything to find it out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be very easy if you much wished it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Probably you have some correspondent in Greece?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At Yanina?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everywhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part
      was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali
      Tepelini.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right,” exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, “I
      will write today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will.”

      Chapter 67. The Office of the King’s Attorney
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>et us leave the
      banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and follow Madame
      Danglars in her morning excursion. We have said that at half-past twelve o’clock
      Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and had left home in the carriage.
      She directed her course towards the Faubourg Saint Germain, went down the
      Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the Passage du Pont-Neuf. She descended, and
      went through the passage. She was very plainly dressed, as would be the
      case with a woman of taste walking in the morning. At the Rue Guénégaud
      she called a cab, and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Harlay. As
      soon as she was seated in the vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very
      thick black veil, which she tied on to her straw bonnet. She then replaced
      the bonnet, and saw with pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her
      white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible. The cab crossed
      the Pont-Neuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphiné; the
      driver was paid as the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs
      Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des Pas-Perdus.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like
      persons at the Palais; business-like persons pay very little attention to
      women, and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more
      attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer. There was a great
      press of people in M. de Villefort’s antechamber, but Madame
      Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name. The instant she
      appeared the door-keeper rose, came to her, and asked her whether she was
      not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment; and on her
      affirmative answer being given, he conducted her by a private passage to
      M. de Villefort’s office. The magistrate was seated in an armchair,
      writing, with his back towards the door; he did not move as he heard it
      open, and the door-keeper pronounce the words, “Walk in, madame,”
      and then reclose it; but no sooner had the man’s footsteps ceased,
      than he started up, drew the bolts, closed the curtains, and examined
      every corner of the room. Then, when he had assured himself that he could
      neither be seen nor heard, and was consequently relieved of doubts, he
      said,—“Thanks, madame,—thanks for your punctuality;”
      and he offered a chair to Madame Danglars, which she accepted, for her
      heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “It is a long time, madame,” said the procureur, describing a
      half-circle with his chair, so as to place himself exactly opposite to
      Madame Danglars,—“it is a long time since I had the pleasure
      of speaking alone with you, and I regret that we have only now met to
      enter upon a painful conversation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless, sir, you see I have answered your first appeal,
      although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than
      for you.” Villefort smiled bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is true, then,” he said, rather uttering his thoughts
      aloud than addressing his companion,—“it is true, then, that
      all our actions leave their traces—some sad, others bright—on
      our paths; it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of
      an insect on the sands;—it leaves its track! Alas, to many the path
      is traced by tears.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Madame Danglars, “you can feel for my
      emotion, can you not? Spare me, then, I beseech you. When I look at this
      room,—whence so many guilty creatures have departed, trembling and
      ashamed, when I look at that chair before which I now sit trembling and
      ashamed,—oh, it requires all my reason to convince me that I am not
      a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge.” Villefort dropped his
      head and sighed. “And I,” he said, “I feel that my place
      is not in the judge’s seat, but on the prisoner’s stool.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “You?” said Madame Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think, sir, you exaggerate your situation,” said Madame
      Danglars, whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment. “The paths of
      which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent
      imaginations. Besides the pleasure, there is always remorse from the
      indulgence of our passions, and, after all, what have you men to fear from
      all this? the world excuses, and notoriety ennobles you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” replied Villefort, “you know that I am no
      hypocrite, or, at least, that I never deceive without a reason. If my brow
      be severe, it is because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be
      petrified, it is that it might sustain the blows it has received. I was
      not so in my youth, I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we
      were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles. But
      since then everything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to
      brave difficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own
      free will, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with me
      in my career. It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire
      is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it, or from
      whom we attempt to snatch it. Thus, the greater number of a man’s
      errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity;
      then, after error has been committed in a moment of excitement, of
      delirium, or of fear, we see that we might have avoided and escaped it.
      The means we might have used, which we in our blindness could not see,
      then seem simple and easy, and we say, ‘Why did I not do this,
      instead of that?’ Women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented with
      remorse; for the decision does not come from you,—your misfortunes
      are generally imposed upon you, and your faults the results of others’
      crimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In any case, sir, you will allow,” replied Madame Danglars,
      “that, even if the fault were alone mine, I last night received a
      severe punishment for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor thing,” said Villefort, pressing her hand, “it was
      too severe for your strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yet——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I must tell you. Collect all your courage, for you have not
      yet heard all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” exclaimed Madame Danglars, alarmed, “what is there
      more to hear?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You only look back to the past, and it is, indeed, bad enough.
      Well, picture to yourself a future more gloomy still—certainly
      frightful, perhaps sanguinary!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was, and his present
      excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream, but
      the sound died in her throat. “How has this terrible past been
      recalled?” cried Villefort; “how is it that it has escaped
      from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts, where it was
      buried, to visit us now, like a phantom, whitening our cheeks and flushing
      our brows with shame?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” said Hermine, “doubtless it is chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chance?” replied Villefort; “No, no, madame, there is
      no such thing as chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? Was it not by
      chance the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house? Was it not by chance
      he caused the earth to be dug up? Is it not by chance that the unfortunate
      child was disinterred under the trees?—that poor innocent offspring
      of mine, which I never even kissed, but for whom I wept many, many tears.
      Ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found
      beneath the flowers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, no, madame,—this is the terrible news I have to tell
      you,” said Villefort in a hollow voice—“no, nothing was
      found beneath the flowers; there was no child disinterred—no. You
      must not weep, no, you must not groan, you must tremble!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What can you mean?” asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean that M. de Monte Cristo, digging underneath these trees,
      found neither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Neither of them there?” repeated Madame Danglars, her
      staring, wide-open eyes expressing her alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Neither of them there!” she again said, as though striving to
      impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, “no,
      a hundred times no!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you did not bury the poor child there, sir? Why did you
      deceive me? Where did you place it? tell me—where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There! But listen to me—listen—and you will pity me who
      has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to
      reveal, without casting the least portion upon you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you frighten me! But speak; I will listen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that
      bed in the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you,
      awaited your delivery. The child was born, was given to me—motionless,
      breathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.” Madame Danglars moved
      rapidly, as though she would spring from her chair, but Villefort stopped,
      and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention. “We thought it
      dead,” he repeated; “I placed it in the chest, which was to
      take the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole, and
      then flung it down in haste. Scarcely had I covered it with earth, when
      the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me; I saw a shadow rise,
      and, at the same time, a flash of light. I felt pain; I wished to cry out,
      but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I fell
      lifeless, and fancied myself killed. Never shall I forget your sublime
      courage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged myself to the
      foot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came to meet me. We
      were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe. You had the
      fortitude to regain the house, assisted by your nurse. A duel was the
      pretext for my wound. Though we scarcely expected it, our secret remained
      in our own keeping alone. I was taken to Versailles; for three months I
      struggled with death; at last, as I seemed to cling to life, I was ordered
      to the South. Four men carried me from Paris to Châlons, walking six
      leagues a day; Madame de Villefort followed the litter in her carriage. At
      Châlons I was put upon the Saône, thence I passed on to the Rhône, whence
      I descended, merely with the current, to Arles; at Arles I was again
      placed on my litter, and continued my journey to Marseilles. My recovery
      lasted six months. I never heard you mentioned, and I did not dare inquire
      for you. When I returned to Paris, I learned that you, the widow of M. de
      Nargonne, had married M. Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness
      returned to me? Always the same—always the child’s corpse,
      coming every night in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over
      the grave with menacing look and gesture. I inquired immediately on my
      return to Paris; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it
      had just been let for nine years. I found the tenant. I pretended that I
      disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife’s father and
      mother should pass into the hands of strangers. I offered to pay them for
      cancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs. I would have given
      10,000—I would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made
      the tenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so
      much wanted, I galloped to Auteuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No one had entered the house since I had left it. It was five o’clock
      in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room, and waited for night.
      There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant
      agony came back with double force. The Corsican, who had declared the
      vendetta against me, who had followed me from Nîmes to Paris, who had hid
      himself in the garden, who had struck me, had seen me dig the grave, had
      seen me inter the child,—he might become acquainted with your
      person,—nay, he might even then have known it. Would he not one day
      make you pay for keeping this terrible secret? Would it not be a sweet
      revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his
      dagger? It was therefore necessary, before everything else, and at all
      risks, that I should cause all traces of the past to disappear—that
      I should destroy every material vestige; too much reality would always
      remain in my recollection. It was for this I had annulled the lease—it
      was for this I had come—it was for this I was waiting. Night
      arrived; I allowed it to become quite dark. I was without a light in that
      room; when the wind shook all the doors, behind which I continually
      expected to see some spy concealed, I trembled. I seemed everywhere to
      hear your moans behind me in the bed, and I dared not turn around. My
      heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would open. At length, one
      by one, all the noises in the neighborhood ceased. I understood that I had
      nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor heard, so I decided
      upon descending to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I
      drew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found in
      my coat—that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you
      wished to have fastened to a golden ring—when I opened the door, and
      saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral
      staircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly shrieked.
      I seemed to be going mad. At last I mastered my agitation. I descended the
      staircase step by step; the only thing I could not conquer was a strange
      trembling in my knees. I grasped the railings; if I had relaxed my hold
      for a moment, I should have fallen. I reached the lower door. Outside this
      door a spade was placed against the wall; I took it, and advanced towards
      the thicket. I had provided myself with a dark lantern. In the middle of
      the lawn I stopped to light it, then I continued my path.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had
      disappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long
      bony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet. My
      terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket, that I
      took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself. I fancied continually that
      I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches. I examined the
      thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty. I looked carefully around; I
      was indeed alone,—no noise disturbed the silence but the owl, whose
      piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night. I tied my
      lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the precise spot
      where I stopped to dig the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer, and when
      autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it. Still one place where the
      grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had turned
      up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had been
      waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked, how I
      hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some resistance
      to my spade! But no, I found nothing, though I had made a hole twice as
      large as the first. I thought I had been deceived—had mistaken the
      spot. I turned around, I looked at the trees, I tried to recall the
      details which had struck me at the time. A cold, sharp wind whistled
      through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my forehead. I
      recollected that I was stabbéd just as I was trampling the ground to fill
      up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a laburnum; behind me was
      an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a resting-place for persons
      walking in the garden; in falling, my hand, relaxing its hold of the
      laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. On my right I saw the tree,
      behind me the rock. I stood in the same attitude, and threw myself down. I
      rose, and again began digging and enlarging the hole; still I found
      nothing, nothing—the chest was no longer there!”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “The chest no longer there?” murmured Madame Danglars, choking
      with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Think not I contented myself with this one effort,” continued
      Villefort. “No; I searched the whole thicket. I thought the
      assassin, having discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure,
      had intended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another
      hole, and deposited it there; but I could find nothing. Then the idea
      struck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply thrown
      it in a corner. In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my
      search. I remained in the room and waited.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, heavens!”

    </h5>
    <p>
      When daylight dawned I went down again. My first visit was to the thicket.
      I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness. I had
      turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square, and a
      depth of two feet. A laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me
      an hour. But I could find nothing—absolutely nothing. Then I renewed
      the search. Supposing it had been thrown aside, it would probably be on
      the path which led to the little gate; but this examination was as useless
      as the first, and with a bursting heart I returned to the thicket, which
      now contained no hope for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” cried Madame Danglars, “it was enough to drive you
      mad!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hoped for a moment that it might,” said Villefort; “but
      that happiness was denied me. However, recovering my strength and my
      ideas, ‘Why,’ said I, ‘should that man have carried away
      the corpse?’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you said,” replied Madame Danglars, “he would
      require it as a proof.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, no, madame, that could not be. Dead bodies are not kept a year;
      they are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. Now, nothing of
      the kind has happened.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What then?” asked Hermine, trembling violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Something more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us—the
      child was, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefort’s
      hands, exclaimed, “My child was alive?” said she; “you
      buried my child alive? You were not certain my child was dead, and you
      buried it? Ah——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands she
      wrung in her feeble grasp. “I know not; I merely suppose so, as I
      might suppose anything else,” replied Villefort with a look so
      fixed, it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and
      madness. “Ah, my child, my poor child!” cried the baroness,
      falling on her chair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief.
      Villefort, becoming somewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the
      maternal storm gathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars
      with the terror he felt. “You understand, then, that if it were so,”
      said he, rising in his turn, and approaching the baroness, to speak to her
      in a lower tone, “we are lost. This child lives, and someone knows
      it lives—someone is in possession of our secret; and since Monte
      Cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred, when that child could not
      be found, it is he who is in possession of our secret.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just God, avenging God!” murmured Madame Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort’s only answer was a stifled groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the child—the child, sir?” repeated the agitated
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How I have searched for him,” replied Villefort, wringing his
      hands; “how I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I
      have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a
      million of men, and to find mine among them! At last, one day, when for
      the hundredth time I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what
      the Corsican could have done with the child. A child encumbers a fugitive;
      perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the
      river.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impossible!” cried Madame Danglars: “a man may murder
      another out of revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps,” continued Villefort, “he had put it in the
      foundling hospital.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, yes,” cried the baroness; “my child is there!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night—the
      night of the 20th of September—a child had been brought there,
      wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. This
      portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron’s crown, and the
      letter H.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Truly, truly,” said Madame Danglars, “all my linen is
      marked thus; Monsieur de Nargonne was a baron, and my name is Hermine.
      Thank God, my child was not then dead!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, it was not dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? Where
      is the child?” Villefort shrugged his shoulders. “Do I know?”
      said he; “and do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you
      all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel
      writer? Alas, no, I know not. A woman, about six months after, came to
      claim it with the other half of the napkin. This woman gave all the
      requisite particulars, and it was intrusted to her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced
      her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what do you think I did? I feigned a criminal process, and
      employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of
      her. They traced her to Châlons, and there they lost her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They lost her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, forever.” Madame Danglars had listened to this recital
      with a sigh, a tear, or a shriek for every detail. “And this is all?”
      said she; “and you stopped there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” said Villefort; “I never ceased to search and
      to inquire. However, the last two or three years I had allowed myself some
      respite. But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever,
      since fear urges me, not my conscience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” replied Madame Danglars, “the Count of Monte
      Cristo can know nothing, or he would not seek our society as he does.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, the wickedness of man is very great,” said Villefort,
      “since it surpasses the goodness of God. Did you observe that man’s
      eyes while he was speaking to us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But have you ever watched him carefully?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck
      me,—of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched
      nothing. I might have suspected he was poisoning us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you see you would have been deceived.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, doubtless.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But believe me, that man has other projects. For that reason I
      wished to see you, to speak to you, to warn you against everyone, but
      especially against him. Tell me,” cried Villefort, fixing his eyes
      more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before, “did you ever
      reveal to anyone our connection?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never, to anyone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You understand me,” replied Villefort, affectionately;
      “when I say anyone,—pardon my urgency,—to anyone living
      I mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, I understand very well,” ejaculated the baroness;
      “never, I swear to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had
      transpired in the morning? Do you keep a journal?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my life has been passed in frivolity; I wish to forget it
      myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you talk in your sleep?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I sleep soundly, like a child; do you not remember?” The
      color mounted to the baroness’s face, and Villefort turned awfully
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is true,” said he, in so low a tone that he could hardly
      be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?” said the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I understand what I now have to do,” replied Villefort.
      “In less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M.
      de Monte Cristo is, whence he comes, where he goes, and why he speaks in
      our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden.”
      Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the
      count shudder had he heard him. Then he pressed the hand the baroness
      reluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the door. Madame
      Danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the other side of
      which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his
      box while waiting for her.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he same day during
      the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur, a
      travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed through the gateway
      of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the door was opened, and
      Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son’s arm. Albert soon
      left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his toilet, drove to the
      Champs-Élysées, to the house of Monte Cristo. The count received him with
      his habitual smile. It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to
      advance a step in that man’s favor. Those who would, as it were,
      force a passage to his heart, found an impassable barrier. Morcerf, who
      ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he drew near, in spite of
      the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand. Monte Cristo shook it
      coldly, according to his invariable practice. “Here I am, dear
      count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Welcome home again.”

      “And I have come at once to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is extremely kind of you,” said Monte Cristo with a tone
      of perfect indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is the news?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything
      for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Had you commissioned me?” said Monte Cristo, feigning
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come,” said Albert, “do not assume so much
      indifference. It is said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tréport, I
      felt the electric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking
      of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Possibly,” said Monte Cristo, “I have indeed thought of
      you, but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my
      knowledge.”
    </p>

      “Indeed? Pray tell me how it happened?”

    </p>
    <p>
      “Not a word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much the worse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I
      am in despair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among
      the number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of you
      at home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way
      in which I think of her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen,” said Morcerf—“if Mademoiselle Danglars
      were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and
      would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families,
      I am ready to agree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars
      would make a charming mistress—but a wife—<i>diable!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And this,” said Monte Cristo, “is your opinion of your
      intended spouse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as
      this dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my
      lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and
      music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens me.
      One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,—good heavens! There she must
      always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are difficult to please, viscount.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To find such a wife as my father found.” Monte Cristo turned
      pale, and looked at Albert, while playing with some magnificent pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your father was fortunate, then?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,—still
      beautiful, witty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have
      stayed with his mother for four days at Tréport, it would have been a
      condescension or a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more
      peaceful—shall I say more poetic!—than if I had taken Queen
      Mab or Titania as my companion.”

    <p>
      “That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make everyone
      vow to live a single life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars.
      Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we
      obtain possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at
      Marlé’s or Fossin’s shines with more splendor when it is our
      own; but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another,
      and still must retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we
      have to endure?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Worldling,” murmured the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a
      pitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has
      millions.” Monte Cristo smiled. “One plan occurred to me,”
      continued Albert; “Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to
      make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four
      letters, written in the most alluring style, he invariably answered:
      ‘My eccentricity may be great, but it will not make me break my
      promise.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one
      whom you would not marry yourself.” Albert smiled.—“Apropos,”
      continued he, “Franz is coming soon, but it will not interest you;
      you dislike him, I think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?” said Monte Cristo; “my dear Viscount, how have you
      discovered that I did not like M. Franz! I like everyone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you include me in the expression everyone—many thanks!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us not mistake,” said Monte Cristo; “I love
      everyone as God commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I
      thoroughly hate but a few. Let us return to M. Franz d’Epinay. Did
      you say he was coming?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to
      get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle
      Eugénie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a
      grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one’s
      pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But M. d’Epinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white
      tie, and speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and
      Madame de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which they deserve, do they not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe
      but a just man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is, then, one,” said Monte Cristo, “whom you do
      not condemn like poor Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,”
      replied Albert, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, my dear sir,” said Monte Cristo, “you are
      revoltingly foppish.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I foppish? how do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to
      struggle to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their
      course; perhaps you may not have to retract.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah,” said Albert, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and
      seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that
      sum to attain the same end.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Am I, indeed, so happy?” said Albert, who still could not
      prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. “But,
      my dear count, has M. Danglars any reason?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the
      self-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is
      attacked with a needle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But yet M. Danglars appeared——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and
      is still more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for
      yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you, I understand. But my mother—no, not my mother; I
      mistake—my father intends giving a ball.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A ball at this season?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Summer balls are fashionable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would
      become so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain
      in Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our
      invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When will it take place?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On Saturday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Cavalcanti’s father will be gone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know him, viscount.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not know him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible
      for him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you receive him at your house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbé, who
      may be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to
      present him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you
      would accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,—besides, I
      may not be there myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At your ball.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why should you not be there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because you have not yet invited me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I come expressly for that purpose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are very kind, but I may be prevented.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all
      impediments.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me what it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My mother begs you to come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Comtesse de Morcerf?” said Monte Cristo, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, count,” said Albert, “I assure you Madame de
      Morcerf speaks freely to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic
      fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely
      devoid of them, for during the last four days we have spoken of no one
      else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have talked of me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her
      too reasonable to be led by imagination.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A problem, my dear count, for everyone—for my mother as well
      as others; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do
      not fear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved. I
      believe, while the Countess G—— takes you for Lord Ruthven, my
      mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The first
      opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for you,
      as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you for the warning,” said the count; “I shall
      endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will, then, come on Saturday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are very kind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will M. Danglars be there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade
      the great d’Aguesseau,[*] M. de Villefort, to come, but have not
      much hope of seeing him.”

      “Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.”

      “Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have
      heard her speak with interest.” Albert rose and took his hat; the
      count conducted him to the door. “I have one thing to reproach
      myself with,” said he, stopping Albert on the steps. “What is
      it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you
      aspect M. d’Epinay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Five or six days hence at the latest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when is he to be married?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure
      you I shall be happy to see him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will obey your orders, my lord.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-bye.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I promised you.” The Count watched Albert, waving his
      hand to him. When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and
      seeing Bertuccio, “What news?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She went to the Palais,” replied the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did she stay long there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An hour and a half.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did she return home?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Directly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my dear Bertuccio,” said the count, “I now advise
      you to go in quest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy.”
      Bertuccio bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order
      he had received, he started the same evening.

      Chapter 69. The Inquiry
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. de Villefort
      kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars, to endeavor to find out
      how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the history of the house at
      Auteuil. He wrote the same day for the required information to M. de
      Boville, who, from having been an inspector of prisons, was promoted to a
      high office in the police; and the latter begged for two days time to
      ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars.
      At the end of the second day M. de Villefort received the following note:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate
      acquaintance of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen in
      Paris and who is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abbé
      Busoni, a Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has done
      much good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made
      respecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the following
      evening he received these details:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “The abbé, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small
      two-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each floor
      and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a
      dining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut,—and a
      wainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was evident
      that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity. He preferred
      to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library than parlor, and
      was furnished with theological books and parchments, in which he delighted
      to bury himself for months at a time, according to his valet de chambre.
      His valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket; and if their
      faces were unknown to him or displeased him, he replied that the abbé was
      not in Paris, an answer which satisfied most persons, because the abbé was
      known to be a great traveller. Besides, whether at home or not, whether in
      Paris or Cairo, the abbé always left something to give away, which the
      valet distributed through this wicket in his master’s name. The
      other room near the library was a bedroom. A bed without curtains, four
      armchairs, and a couch, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, composed, with
      a <i>prie-Dieu</i>, all its furniture. Lord Wilmore resided in Rue
      Fontaine-Saint-George. He was one of those English tourists who consume a
      large fortune in travelling. He hired the apartment in which he lived
      furnished, passed only a few hours in the day there, and rarely slept
      there. One of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of French, which
      he however wrote with great facility.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after this important information had been given to the king’s
      attorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue Férou,
      and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the Abbé Busoni were within.
      “No, he went out early this morning,” replied the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I might not always be content with that answer,” replied the
      visitor, “for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home. But
      have the kindness to give the Abbé Busoni——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you he was not at home,” repeated the valet. “Then
      on his return give him that card and this sealed paper. Will he be at home
      at eight o’clock this evening?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were
      out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will come again at that time,” replied the visitor, who
      then retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage, which,
      instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Férou, drove up to the
      green door. He knocked, and it opened immediately to admit him. From the
      signs of respect the valet paid him, he saw that his note had produced a
      good effect. “Is the abbé at home?” asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir,”
      replied the valet. The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a
      table, illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade
      while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the
      abbé in a monk’s dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by
      learned men of the Middle Ages. “Have I the honor of addressing the
      Abbé Busoni?” asked the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” replied the abbé; “and you are the person
      whom M. de Boville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the
      prefect of police?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir” replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and
      blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbé replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes
      but his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same.
      “I am at your service, sir,” said the abbé, with a marked
      Italian accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The mission with which I am charged, sir,” replied the
      visitor, speaking with hesitation, “is a confidential one on the
      part of him who fulfils it, and him by whom he is employed.” The
      abbé bowed. “Your probity,” replied the stranger, “is so
      well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from
      you some particulars connected with the public safety, to ascertain which
      I am deputed to see you. It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane
      consideration will induce you to conceal the truth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Provided, sir, the particulars you wish for do not interfere with
      my scruples or my conscience. I am a priest, sir, and the secrets of
      confession, for instance, must remain between me and God, and not between
      me and human justice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your
      conscience.”

      At this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised
      it on the other, throwing a bright light on the stranger’s face,
      while his own remained obscured. “Excuse me, abbé,” said the
      envoy of the prefect of the police, “but the light tries my eyes
      very much.” The abbé lowered the shade. “Now, sir, I am
      listening—go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will come at once to the point. Do you know the Count of Monte
      Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Zaccone?—is not his name Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and
      not a family name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, be it so—let us not dispute about words; and since M.
      de Monte Cristo and M. Zaccone are the same——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Absolutely the same.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us speak of M. Zaccone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Agreed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I asked you if you knew him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Extremely well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does
      not content itself with vague reports.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However,” replied the abbé, with an affable smile, “when
      that report is in accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it,
      the police as well as all the rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you sure of what you assert?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean by that question?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Understand, sir, I do not in the least suspect your veracity; I ask
      if you are certain of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I knew his father, M. Zaccone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But whence does he derive the title of count?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are aware that may be bought.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In Italy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everywhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They may not be so very great.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How much do you suppose he possesses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per
      annum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is reasonable,” said the visitor; “I have heard he
      had three or four millions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I was told he had four millions per annum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not probable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, everyone who has come from Palermo, Naples, or Rome to
      France by sea must know it, since he has passed close to it and must have
      seen it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am told it is a delightful place?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a rock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why has the count bought a rock?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For the sake of being a count. In Italy one must have territorial
      possessions to be a count.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have, doubtless, heard the adventures of M. Zaccone’s
      youth?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The father’s?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, the son’s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of
      my young comrade.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was he in the wars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think he entered the service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what branch?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the navy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you not his confessor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Lutheran?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say, I believe such is the case, I do not affirm it; besides,
      liberty of conscience is established in France.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his
      actions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He passes for a very charitable man. Our holy father, the pope, has
      made him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the
      Christians in the East; he has five or six rings as testimonials from
      Eastern monarchs of his services.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does he wear them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but he is proud of them; he is better pleased with rewards
      given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a Quaker then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly, he is a Quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has he any friends?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, everyone who knows him is his friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But has he any enemies?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One only.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is his name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord Wilmore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is in Paris just now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can he give me any particulars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Important ones; he was in India with Zaccone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know his abode?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s somewhere in the Chaussée d’Antin; but I know
      neither the street nor the number.”

    <p>
      “Are you at variance with the Englishman?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I love Zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France
      before he made this visit to Paris?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To that question I can answer positively; no, sir, he had not,
      because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required,
      and as I did not know when I might again come to Paris, I recommended M.
      Cavalcanti to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Andrea?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Bartolomeo, his father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in
      the name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me candidly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house
      at Auteuil?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, for he told me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To make a lunatic asylum of it, similar to that founded by the
      Count of Pisani at Palermo. Do you know about that institution?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have heard of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a magnificent charity.” Having said this, the abbé
      bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies. The visitor either
      understood the abbé’s meaning, or had no more questions to ask; he
      arose, and the abbé accompanied him to the door. “You are a great
      almsgiver,” said the visitor, “and although you are said to be
      rich, I will venture to offer you something for your poor people; will you
      accept my offering?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you, sir; I am only jealous in one thing, and that is that
      the relief I give should be entirely from my own resources.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search
      for yourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to
      exercise your benevolence.” The abbé once more bowed as he opened
      the door, the stranger bowed and took his leave, and the carriage conveyed
      him straight to the house of M. de Villefort. An hour afterwards the
      carriage was again ordered, and this time it went to the Rue
      Fontaine-Saint-George, and stopped at No. 5, where Lord Wilmore lived. The
      stranger had written to Lord Wilmore, requesting an interview, which the
      latter had fixed for ten o’clock. As the envoy of the prefect of
      police arrived ten minutes before ten, he was told that Lord Wilmore, who
      was precision and punctuality personified, was not yet come in, but that
      he would be sure to return as the clock struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all other
      furnished drawing-rooms. A mantle-piece, with two modern Sèvres vases, a
      timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with an engraving
      on each side—one representing Homer carrying his guide, the other,
      Belisarius begging—a grayish paper; red and black tapestry—such
      was the appearance of Lord Wilmore’s drawing-room. It was
      illuminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a feeble
      light, as if out of consideration for the envoy’s weak sight. After
      ten minutes’ expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth stroke
      the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared. He was rather above the middle
      height, with thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and light hair,
      turning rather gray. He was dressed with all the English peculiarity,
      namely, in a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar, in the fashion
      of 1811, a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, three
      inches too short, but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to
      the knee. His first remark on entering was,—“You know, sir, I
      do not speak French?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know you do not like to converse in our language,” replied
      the envoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you may use it,” replied Lord Wilmore; “I
      understand it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I,” replied the visitor, changing his idiom, “know
      enough of English to keep up the conversation. Do not put yourself to the
      slightest inconvenience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aw?” said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to
      natives of Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read with
      English coolness, and having finished,—“I understand,”
      said he, “perfectly.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been
      addressed to the Abbé Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of the
      count’s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more
      numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten
      years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of India
      who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met him and
      fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner, sent
      to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had escaped by swimming.
      Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices; then the insurrection in
      Greece broke out, and he had served in the Grecian ranks. While in that
      service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly, but
      he had been careful to conceal it from everyone. After the battle of
      Navarino, when the Greek government was consolidated, he asked of King
      Otho a mining grant for that district, which was given him. Hence that
      immense fortune, which, in Lord Wilmore’s opinion, possibly amounted
      to one or two millions per annum,—a precarious fortune, which might
      be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” asked the visitor, “do you know why he came to
      France?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is speculating in railways,” said Lord Wilmore, “and
      as he is an expert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of
      telegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How much does he spend yearly?” asked the prefect.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs,” said Lord
      Wilmore; “he is a miser.” Hatred evidently inspired the
      Englishman, who, knowing no other reproach to bring on the count, accused
      him of avarice. “Do you know his house at Auteuil?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you know respecting it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you wish to know why he bought it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count is a speculator, who will certainly ruin himself in
      experiments. He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has
      bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnères, Luchon, and Cauterets.
      He is going to turn his house into a <i>Badhaus</i>, as the Germans term
      it. He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the
      famous spring, and, being unsuccessful, he will soon purchase all the
      contiguous houses. Now, as I dislike him, and hope his railway, his
      electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin him, I am watching
      for his discomfiture, which must soon take place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What was the cause of your quarrel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you not seek revenge?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have already fought three duels with him,” said the
      Englishman, “the first with the pistol, the second with the sword,
      and the third with the sabre.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what was the result of those duels?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the
      breast; and the third time, made this large wound.” The Englishman
      turned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved it
      to be a recent one. “So that, you see, there is a deadly feud
      between us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said the envoy, “you do not go about it in the
      right way to kill him, if I understand you correctly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aw?” said the Englishman, “I practice shooting every
      day, and every other day Grisier comes to my house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all the visitor wished to ascertain, or, rather, all the
      Englishman appeared to know. The agent arose, and having bowed to Lord
      Wilmore, who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the
      English, he retired. Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after him,
      returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his light hair,
      his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume the black hair,
      dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte Cristo. It was M.
      de Villefort, and not the prefect, who returned to the house of M. de
      Villefort. The procureur felt more at ease, although he had learned
      nothing really satisfactory, and, for the first time since the
      dinner-party at Auteuil, he slept soundly.

      Chapter 70. The Ball
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was in the
      warmest days of July, when in due course of time the Saturday arrived upon
      which the ball was to take place at M. de Morcerf’s. It was ten o’clock
      at night; the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count’s
      house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven, which was
      studded with golden stars, but where the last fleeting clouds of a
      vanishing storm yet lingered. From the apartments on the ground floor
      might be heard the sound of music, with the whirl of the waltz and galop,
      while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the
      Venetian blinds. At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten
      servants, who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the
      supper, the serenity of the weather continuing to increase. Until now, it
      had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the
      dining-room, or under a long tent erected on the lawn, but the beautiful
      blue sky, studded with stars, had settled the question in favor of the
      lawn. The gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns, according to the
      Italian custom, and, as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the
      table—the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form—are
      well understood, the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers.

    <p>
      At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving
      her orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming
      hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the
      count; for, owing to the good taste of Mercédès, one was sure of finding
      some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even copying in
      case of need. Madame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had
      caused deep anxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf’s,
      when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort.
      The latter made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together,
      said, “You are going to Madame de Morcerf’s, are you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Madame Danglars, “I am too ill.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are wrong,” replied Villefort, significantly; “it
      is important that you should be seen there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think so?” asked the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case I will go.” And the two carriages passed on
      towards their different destinations. Madame Danglars therefore came, not
      only beautiful in person, but radiant with splendor; she entered by one
      door at the time when Mercédès appeared at the door. The countess took
      Albert to meet Madame Danglars. He approached, paid her some well merited
      compliments on her toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat.
      Albert looked around him. “You are looking for my daughter?”
      said the baroness, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I confess it,” replied Albert. “Could you have been so
      cruel as not to bring her?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Calm yourself. She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort, and has taken
      her arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a
      bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. But tell me——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what do you wish to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Seventeen!” replied Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I only mean that the count seems the rage,” replied the
      viscount, smiling, “and that you are the seventeenth person that has
      asked me the same question. The count is in fashion; I congratulate him
      upon it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have you replied to everyone as you have to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, to be sure, I have not answered you; be satisfied, we shall
      have this ‘lion’; we are among the privileged ones.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were you at the Opera yesterday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed? And did the eccentric person commit any new
      originality?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can he be seen without doing so? Elssler was dancing in <i>Le
      Diable boiteux</i>; the Greek princess was in ecstasies. After the
      cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw
      it to the charming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the
      gift, reappeared with it on her finger. And the Greek princess,—will
      she be here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the
      count’s establishment is not sufficiently understood.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who
      is trying to attract your attention.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert bowed to Madame Danglars, and advanced towards Madame de Villefort,
      whose lips opened as he approached. “I wager anything,” said
      Albert, interrupting her, “that I know what you were about to say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I guess rightly, will you confess it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On your honor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On my honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived,
      or was expected.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all. It is not of him that I am now thinking. I was going to
      ask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,—yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did he tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That he was leaving at the same time as his letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, now then, the count?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count will come, of that you may be satisfied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I did not know it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monte Cristo is the name of an island, and he has a family name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never heard it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, I am better informed than you; his name is Zaccone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a Maltese.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is also possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The son of a shipowner.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the
      greatest success.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to
      Paris to establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I’m sure,” said Morcerf, “this is indeed
      news! Am I allowed to repeat it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I
      told you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because it is a secret just discovered.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The police.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then the news originated——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the prefect’s last night. Paris, you can understand, is
      astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor, and the police have made
      inquiries.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well! Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a
      vagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had
      not been so favorable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor count! And is he aware of the danger he has been in?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then it will be but charitable to inform him. When he arrives, I
      will not fail to do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and glossy
      moustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort. Albert extended his
      hand. “Madame,” said Albert, “allow me to present to you
      M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis, one of our best, and, above all,
      of our bravest officers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at
      Auteuil, at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo,” replied Madame
      de Villefort, turning away with marked coldness of manner. This answer,
      and especially the tone in which it was uttered, chilled the heart of poor
      Morrel. But a recompense was in store for him; turning around, he saw near
      the door a beautiful fair face, whose large blue eyes were, without any
      marked expression, fixed upon him, while the bouquet of myosotis was
      gently raised to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same
      expression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these
      two living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble
      aspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room, forgot
      themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their mutual
      contemplation. They might have remained much longer lost in one another,
      without anyone noticing their abstraction. The Count of Monte Cristo had
      just entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted
      universal attention wherever he appeared. It was not the coat,
      unexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was not the
      plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed the foot so
      perfectly formed—it was none of these things that attracted the
      attention,—it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his
      calm and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth,
      chiselled with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such
      high disdain,—these were what fixed the attention of all upon him.
      Many men might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none
      whose appearance was more <i>significant</i>, if the expression may be
      used. Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the
      constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and
      vigor to the expression of his face, and even to the most trifling
      gesture, scarcely to be understood. Yet the Parisian world is so strange,
      that even all this might not have won attention had there not been
      connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.

    <p>
      Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of
      curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before a
      mantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a
      looking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive him.
      She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was
      bowing to her. No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her, while on
      his side the count thought she was about to address him; but both remained
      silent, and after a mere bow, Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert,
      who received him cordially. “Have you seen my mother?” asked
      Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have just had the pleasure,” replied the count; “but
      I have not seen your father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “See, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of
      great geniuses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “and so those gentlemen
      down there are men of great talent. I should not have guessed it. And for
      what kind of talent are they celebrated? You know there are different
      sorts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the
      neighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards
      usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the Institute.
      The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided in his favor.
      I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world, and
      the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor, was made an
      officer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be
      wisely awarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they
      would have made him a commander.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very likely,” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap
      himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s,
      which deputed David [*] to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * Louis David, a famous French painter.
</pre>
    <p>
      “Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an
      Academician?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is his especial talent?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits,
      he makes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with
      whalebone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; of the French Academy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was going to tell you. It seems——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of
      science, doubtless?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; that his style of writing is very good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into
      whose heads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red,
      and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the other one?” demanded the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That one?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, the third.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The one in the dark blue coat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active
      opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He
      was very successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal
      papers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting
      him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an
      ambassador.”

    <p>
      “And what are his claims to the peerage?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five
      articles in the <i>Siècle</i>, and voted five or six years on the
      ministerial side.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bravo, Viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are
      a delightful <i>cicerone</i>. And now you will do me a favor, will you
      not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish
      it, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He
      turned round; it was Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, is it you, baron?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know
      that I care nothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like
      your title, do you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my
      title I should be nothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still
      remain the millionaire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,”
      replied Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title
      to a millionaire does not last for life, like that of baron, peer of
      France, or academician; for example, the millionaires Franck &amp;
      Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have just become bankrupts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a
      million in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, <i>mon Dieu!</i>” exclaimed Danglars, “they have
      drawn on me for 200,000 francs!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five
      per cent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have
      honored their bills.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone
      after——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush, do not mention these things,” said Danglars; then,
      approaching Monte Cristo, he added, “especially before young M.
      Cavalcanti;” after which he smiled, and turned towards the young man
      in question. Albert had left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to
      converse with young Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone.
      Meanwhile the heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through
      the rooms with waiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the
      perspiration from his forehead, but drew back when the waiter was
      presented to him; he took no refreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose
      sight of Monte Cristo; she saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his
      gesture of refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Albert,” she asked, “did you notice that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, mother?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the
      roof of M. de Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but then he breakfasted with me—indeed, he made his
      first appearance in the world on that occasion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But your house is not M. de Morcerf’s,” murmured
      Mercédès; “and since he has been here I have watched him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, he has taken nothing yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The count is very temperate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercédès smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Approach him,” said she, “and when the next waiter
      passes, insist upon his taking something.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why, mother?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just to please me, Albert,” said Mercédès. Albert kissed his
      mother’s hand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed,
      loaded like the preceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the
      count, but he obstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was
      very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said she, “you see he refuses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but why need this annoy you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know, Albert, women are singular creatures. I should like to
      have seen the count take something in my house, if only an ice. Perhaps he
      cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might prefer
      something else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he
      does not feel inclined this evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And besides,” said the countess, “accustomed as he is
      to burning climates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost
      suffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as
      the windows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In a word,” said Mercédès, “it was a way of assuring me
      that his abstinence was intended.” And she left the room. A minute
      afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the jessamine and
      clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with
      lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent. Dancers, players, talkers,
      all uttered an exclamation of joy—everyone inhaled with delight the
      breeze that floated in. At the same time Mercédès reappeared, paler than
      before, but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she
      sometimes wore. She went straight to the group of which her husband formed
      the centre. “Do not detain those gentlemen here, count,” she
      said; “they would prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden
      rather than suffocate here, since they are not playing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung <i>Partant
      pour la Syrie</i>,—“we will not go alone to the garden.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Mercédès, “I will lead the way.”
      Turning towards Monte Cristo, she added, “count, will you oblige me
      with your arm?” The count almost staggered at these simple words;
      then he fixed his eyes on Mercédès. It was only a momentary glance, but it
      seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century, so much was expressed
      in that one look. He offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or
      rather just touched it with her little hand, and they together descended
      the steps, lined with rhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, by another
      outlet, a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud
      exclamations of delight.

      entered an archway of trees with her companion. It led through a grove of
      lindens to a conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the
      doors and the blinds.” As he ceased speaking, the count felt the
      hand of Mercédès tremble. “But you,” he said, “with that
      light dress, and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf,
      perhaps you feel cold?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know where I am leading you?” said the countess,
      without replying to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but you see I make
      no resistance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the
      grove.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The count looked at Mercédès as if to interrogate her, but she continued
      to walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking. They reached the
      building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen at the beginning
      of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun, so
      frequently absent in our climate. The countess left the arm of Monte
      Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes. “See, count,”
      she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost
      detect the tears on her eyelids—“see, our French grapes are
      not to be compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but you will
      make allowance for our northern sun.” The count bowed, but stepped
      back. “Do you refuse?” said Mercédès, in a tremulous voice.
      “Pray excuse me, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “but I
      never eat Muscatel grapes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercédès let them fall, and sighed. A magnificent peach was hanging
      against an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat. Mercédès
      drew near, and plucked the fruit. “Take this peach, then,” she
      said. The count again refused. “What, again?” she exclaimed,
      in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob; “really,
      you pain me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the ground.
      “Count,” added Mercédès with a supplicating glance, “there
      is a beautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who
      have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it, madame,” replied the count; “but we are in
      France, and not in Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare
      as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on
      Monte Cristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, “we
      are friends, are we not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then
      again rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of a
      man suddenly dazzled. “Certainly, we are friends,” he replied;
      “why should we not be?” The answer was so little like the one
      Mercédès desired, that she turned away to give vent to a sigh, which
      sounded more like a groan. “Thank you,” she said. And they
      walked on again. They went the whole length of the garden without uttering
      a word. “Sir,” suddenly exclaimed the countess, after their
      walk had continued ten minutes in silence, “is it true that you have
      seen so much, travelled so far, and suffered so deeply?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have suffered deeply, madame,” answered Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But now you are happy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless,” replied the count, “since no one hears me
      complain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My present happiness equals my past misery,” said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you not married?” asked the countess. “I, married?”
      exclaimed Monte Cristo, shuddering; “who could have told you so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the
      opera with a young and lovely woman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople, madame, the
      daughter of a prince. I have adopted her as my daughter, having no one
      else to love in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You live alone, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have no sister—no son—no father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have no one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not my fault, madame. At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on
      the point of marrying her, when war came and carried me away. I thought
      she loved me well enough to wait for me, and even to remain faithful to my
      memory. When I returned she was married. This is the history of most men
      who have passed twenty years of age. Perhaps my heart was weaker than the
      hearts of most men, and I suffered more than they would have done in my
      place; that is all.” The countess stopped for a moment, as if
      gasping for breath. “Yes,” she said, “and you have still
      preserved this love in your heart—one can only love once—and
      did you ever see her again?”

      “Never.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never returned to the country where she lived.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Malta?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; Malta.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is, then, now at Malta?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Her,—yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hate them? Not at all; why should I?” The countess placed
      herself before Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the
      perfumed grapes. “Take some,” she said. “Madame, I never
      eat Muscatel grapes,” replied Monte Cristo, as if the subject had
      not been mentioned before. The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest
      thicket, with a gesture of despair. “Inflexible man!” she
      murmured. Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been
      addressed to him. Albert at this moment ran in. “Oh, mother,”
      he exclaimed, “such a misfortune has happened!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? What has happened?” asked the countess, as though
      awakening from a sleep to the realities of life; “did you say a
      misfortune? Indeed, I should expect misfortunes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Villefort is here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He comes to fetch his wife and daughter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because Madame de Saint-Méran is just arrived in Paris, bringing
      the news of M. de Saint-Méran’s death, which took place on the first
      stage after he left Marseilles. Madame de Villefort, who was in very good
      spirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but
      Mademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth,
      notwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her
      like a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how was M. de Saint-Méran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?”
      said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was her grandfather on the mother’s side. He was coming
      here to hasten her marriage with Franz.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, indeed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So Franz must wait. Why was not M. de Saint-Méran also grandfather
      to Mademoiselle Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Albert, Albert,” said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild
      reproof, “what are you saying? Ah, count, he esteems you so highly,
      tell him that he has spoken amiss.” And she took two or three steps
      forward. Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful, and so full
      of affectionate admiration, that she turned back and grasped his hand; at
      the same time she seized that of her son, and joined them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are friends; are we not?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, madame, I do not presume to call myself your friend, but at all
      times I am your most respectful servant.” The countess left with an
      indescribable pang in her heart, and before she had taken ten steps the
      count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes. “Do not my mother
      and you agree?” asked Albert, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary,” replied the count, “did you not hear
      her declare that we were friends?” They re-entered the drawing-room,
      which Valentine and Madame de Villefort had just quitted. It is perhaps
      needless to add that Morrel departed almost at the same time.

    <h2>
      Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-Méran
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> gloomy scene had
      indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort. After the ladies had
      departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort
      had failed in persuading him to accompany them, the procureur had shut
      himself up in his study, according to his custom, with a heap of papers
      calculated to alarm anyone else, but which generally scarcely satisfied
      his inordinate desires. But this time the papers were a mere matter of
      form. Villefort had secluded himself, not to study, but to reflect; and
      with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed
      excepting for important business, he sat down in his armchair and began to
      ponder over the events, the remembrance of which had during the last eight
      days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter
      recollections. Then, instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled
      before him, he opened the drawer of his desk, touched a spring, and drew
      out a parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst which he had carefully
      arranged, in characters only known to himself, the names of all those who,
      either in his political career, in money matters, at the bar, or in his
      mysterious love affairs, had become his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet these
      names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile with the
      same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit
      of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the almost
      impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has so
      perilously climbed. When he had run over all these names in his memory,
      again read and studied them, commenting meanwhile upon his lists, he shook
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” he murmured, “none of my enemies would have waited
      so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time, that they might
      now come and crush me with this secret. Sometimes, as Hamlet says—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">      ‘Foul deeds will rise,
      Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes;’
</pre>
    <p>
      but, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead. The story has been
      told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has repeated it. M.
      de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten himself—but why
      should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?” asked
      Villefort, after a moment’s reflection, “what interest can
      this M. de Monte Cristo or M. Zaccone,—son of a shipowner of Malta,
      discoverer of a mine in Thessaly, now visiting Paris for the first time,—what
      interest, I say, can he take in discovering a gloomy, mysterious, and
      useless fact like this? However, among all the incoherent details given to
      me by the Abbé Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that enemy,
      one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion—that in no period,
      in no case, in no circumstance, could there have been any contact between
      him and me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe. He
      dreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its
      truth;—he cared little for that <i>mene, mene, tekel upharsin</i>,
      which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;—but what
      he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them.
      While he was endeavoring to calm his fears,—and instead of dwelling
      upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his
      ambitious dreams, was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of
      home, in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept,—the
      noise of a carriage sounded in the yard, then he heard the steps of an
      aged person ascending the stairs, followed by tears and lamentations, such
      as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in
      their master’s grief. He drew back the bolt of his door, and almost
      directly an old lady entered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her arm,
      and her bonnet in her hand. The white hair was thrown back from her yellow
      forehead, and her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now almost
      disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief. “Oh, sir,”
      she said; “oh, sir, what a misfortune! I shall die of it; oh, yes, I
      shall certainly die of it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a
      paroxysm of sobs. The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to
      approach nearer, were looking at Noirtier’s old servant, who had
      heard the noise from his master’s room, and run there also,
      remaining behind the others. Villefort rose, and ran towards his
      mother-in-law, for it was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, what can have happened?” he exclaimed, “what has
      thus disturbed you? Is M. de Saint-Méran with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Saint-Méran is dead,” answered the old marchioness,
      without preface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied.
      Villefort drew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed—“Dead!—so
      suddenly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A week ago,” continued Madame de Saint-Méran, “we went
      out together in the carriage after dinner. M. de Saint-Méran had been
      unwell for some days; still, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again
      inspired him with courage, and notwithstanding his illness he would leave.
      At six leagues from Marseilles, after having eaten some of the lozenges he
      is accustomed to take, he fell into such a deep sleep, that it appeared to
      me unnatural; still I hesitated to wake him, although I fancied that his
      face was flushed, and that the veins of his temples throbbed more
      violently than usual. However, as it became dark, and I could no longer
      see, I fell asleep; I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek, as from a
      person suffering in his dreams, and he suddenly threw his head back
      violently. I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M. de
      Saint-Méran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I arrived
      at Aix by the side of a corpse.” Villefort stood with his mouth half
      open, quite stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course you sent for a doctor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Immediately; but, as I have told you, it was too late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had
      died.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic
      stroke.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what did you do then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Saint-Méran had always expressed a desire, in case his death
      happened during his absence from Paris, that his body might be brought to
      the family vault. I had him put into a leaden coffin, and I am preceding
      him by a few days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, my poor mother,” said Villefort, “to have such
      duties to perform at your age after such a blow!”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      “God has supported me through all; and then, my dear marquis, he
      would certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him. It
      is true that since I left him, I seem to have lost my senses. I cannot
      cry; at my age they say that we have no more tears,—still I think
      that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping. Where is
      Valentine, sir? It is on her account I am here; I wish to see Valentine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that Valentine was at a
      ball; so he only said that she had gone out with her step-mother, and that
      she should be fetched. “This instant, sir—this instant, I
      beseech you!” said the old lady. Villefort placed the arm of Madame
      de Saint-Méran within his own, and conducted her to his apartment. “Rest
      yourself, mother,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness raised her head at this word, and beholding the man who so
      forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child, who still lived for
      her in Valentine, she felt touched at the name of mother, and bursting
      into tears, she fell on her knees before an armchair, where she buried her
      venerable head. Villefort left her to the care of the women, while old
      Barrois ran, half-scared, to his master; for nothing frightens old people
      so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in
      order to strike some other old person. Then, while Madame de Saint-Méran
      remained on her knees, praying fervently, Villefort sent for a cab, and
      went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from Madame de Morcerf’s.
      He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball-room, that
      Valentine ran to him, saying—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, father, some misfortune has happened!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your grandmamma has just arrived, Valentine,” said M. de
      Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And grandpapa?” inquired the young girl, trembling with
      apprehension. M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his
      daughter. It was just in time, for Valentine’s head swam, and she
      staggered; Madame de Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and
      aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage, saying—“What
      a singular event! Who could have thought it? Ah, yes, it is indeed
      strange!” And the wretched family departed, leaving a cloud of
      sadness hanging over the rest of the evening. At the foot of the stairs,
      Valentine found Barrois awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Noirtier wishes to see you tonight, he said, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma,” she
      replied, feeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be
      of the most service just then was Madame de Saint-Méran. Valentine found
      her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung sobs, broken sighs,
      burning tears, were all that passed in this sad interview, while Madame de
      Villefort, leaning on her husband’s arm, maintained all outward
      forms of respect, at least towards the poor widow. She soon whispered to
      her husband, “I think it would be better for me to retire, with your
      permission, for the sight of me appears still to afflict your
      mother-in-law.” Madame de Saint-Méran heard her. “Yes, yes,”
      she said softly to Valentine, “let her leave; but do you stay.”
      Madame de Villefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed, for
      the procureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death, had
      followed his wife. Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first time to
      old Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as we have
      said, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return, his quick
      intelligent eye interrogated the messenger. “Alas, sir,”
      exclaimed Barrois, “a great misfortune has happened. Madame de
      Saint-Méran has arrived, and her husband is dead!”
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Saint-Méran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of
      friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects
      another. Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently overwhelmed
      and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of inquiry. “Mademoiselle
      Valentine?” Noirtier nodded his head. “She is at the ball, as
      you know, since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress.”
      Noirtier again closed his left eye. “Do you wish to see her?”
      Noirtier again made an affirmative sign. “Well, they have gone to
      fetch her, no doubt, from Madame de Morcerf’s; I will await her
      return, and beg her to come up here. Is that what you wish for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and informed
      her of her grandfather’s wish. Consequently, Valentine came up to
      Noirtier, on leaving Madame de Saint-Méran, who in the midst of her grief
      had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep. Within
      reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of
      orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. Then, as we have said, the
      young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier. Valentine kissed the old
      man, who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled
      with tears, whose sources he thought must be exhausted. The old gentleman
      continued to dwell upon her with the same expression. “Yes, yes,”
      said Valentine, “you mean that I have yet a kind grandfather left,
      do you not.” The old man intimated that such was his meaning.
      “Ah, yes, happily I have,” replied Valentine. “Without
      that, what would become of me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one o’clock in the morning. Barrois, who wished to go to bed
      himself, observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of
      rest. Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his
      child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made her
      appear quite ill. The next morning she found her grandmother in bed; the
      fever had not abated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared
      to be suffering from violent nervous irritability. “Oh, dear
      grandmamma, are you worse?” exclaimed Valentine, perceiving all
      these signs of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my child, no,” said Madame de Saint-Méran; “but I
      was impatiently waiting for your arrival, that I might send for your
      father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father?” inquired Valentine, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I wish to speak to him.” Valentine durst not oppose her
      grandmother’s wish, the cause of which she did not know, and an
      instant afterwards Villefort entered. “Sir,” said Madame de
      Saint-Méran, without using any circumlocution, and as if fearing she had
      no time to lose, “you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this
      child?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, madame,” replied Villefort, “it is not only
      projected but arranged.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your intended son-in-law is named M. Franz d’Epinay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, madame.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is he not the son of General d’Epinay who was on our side,
      and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the
      Island of Elba?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The same.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a
      Jacobin?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,”
      said Villefort; “M. d’Epinay was quite a child when his father
      died, he knows very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with
      pleasure, at least with indifference.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it a suitable match?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In every respect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the young man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is regarded with universal esteem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You approve of him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is one of the most well-bred young men I know.” During the
      whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent. “Well,
      sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, after a few minutes’
      reflection, “I must hasten the marriage, for I have but a short time
      to live.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You, madame?” “You, dear mamma?” exclaimed M. de
      Villefort and Valentine at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know what I am saying,” continued the marchioness; “I
      must hurry you, so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a
      grandmother to bless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging
      to my poor Renée, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, madame,” said Villefort, “you forget that I was
      obliged to give a mother to my child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the
      purpose,—our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in
      peace.”
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was something
      in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It shall be as you wish, madame,” said Villefort; “more
      especially since your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. d’Epinay
      arrives in Paris——”

    <p>
      “My dear grandmother,” interrupted Valentine, “consider
      decorum—the recent death. You would not have me marry under such sad
      auspices?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My child,” exclaimed the old lady sharply, “let us hear
      none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing
      for the future. I also was married at the death-bed of my mother, and
      certainly I have not been less happy on that account.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still that idea of death, madame,” said Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still?—Always! I tell you I am going to die—do you
      understand? Well, before dying, I wish to see my son-in-law. I wish to
      tell him to make my child happy; I wish to read in his eyes whether he
      intends to obey me;—in fact, I will know him—I will!”
      continued the old lady, with a fearful expression, “that I may rise
      from the depths of my grave to find him, if he should not fulfil his duty!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame,” said Villefort, “you must lay aside these
      exalted ideas, which almost assume the appearance of madness. The dead,
      once buried in their graves, rise no more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken. This night I have had a
      fearful sleep. It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my
      body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and what
      will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes shut, in
      the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner where there
      is a door leading into Madame Villefort’s dressing-room—I saw,
      I tell you, silently enter, a white figure.” Valentine screamed.
      “It was the fever that disturbed you, madame,” said Villefort.

      “Doubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say. I saw a white
      figure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of
      my senses, I heard my glass removed—the same which is there now on
      the table.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, dear mother, it was a dream.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So little was it a dream, that I stretched my hand towards the
      bell; but when I did so, the shade disappeared; my maid then entered with
      a light.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But she saw no one?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them. It was
      the soul of my husband!—Well, if my husband’s soul can come to
      me, why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter? the tie is
      even more direct, it seems to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, madame,” said Villefort, deeply affected, in spite of
      himself, “do not yield to those gloomy thoughts; you will long live
      with us, happy, loved, and honored, and we will make you forget——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never, never, never,” said the marchioness. “When does
      M. d’Epinay return?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We expect him every moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is well. As soon as he arrives inform me. We must be
      expeditious. And then I also wish to see a notary, that I may be assured
      that all our property returns to Valentine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, grandmamma,” murmured Valentine, pressing her lips on the
      burning brow, “do you wish to kill me? Oh, how feverish you are; we
      must not send for a notary, but for a doctor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A doctor?” said she, shrugging her shoulders, “I am not
      ill; I am thirsty—that is all.”

    <p>
      “What are you drinking, dear grandmamma?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The same as usual, my dear, my glass is there on the table—give
      it to me, Valentine.” Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass
      and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread, for it was
      the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre. The
      marchioness drained the glass at a single draught, and then turned on her
      pillow, repeating,—“The notary, the notary!”
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Villefort left the room, and Valentine seated herself at the bedside
      of her grandmother. The poor child appeared herself to require the doctor
      she had recommended to her aged relative. A bright spot burned in either
      cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and her pulse beat with
      feverish excitement. She was thinking of the despair of Maximilian, when
      he should be informed that Madame de Saint-Méran, instead of being an
      ally, was unconsciously acting as his enemy. More than once she thought of
      revealing all to her grandmother, and she would not have hesitated a
      moment, if Maximilian Morrel had been named Albert de Morcerf or Raoul de
      Château-Renaud; but Morrel was of plebeian extraction, and Valentine knew
      how the haughty Marquise de Saint-Méran despised all who were not noble.
      Her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it,
      by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so; for, were it once
      discovered by her father and mother, all would be lost. Two hours passed
      thus; Madame de Saint-Méran was in a feverish sleep, and the notary had
      arrived. Though his coming was announced in a very low tone, Madame de
      Saint-Méran arose from her pillow. “The notary!” she
      exclaimed, “let him come in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary, who was at the door, immediately entered. “Go,
      Valentine,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, “and leave me with
      this gentleman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, grandmamma——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leave me—go!” The young girl kissed her grandmother,
      and left with her handkerchief to her eyes; at the door she found the
      valet de chambre, who told her that the doctor was waiting in the
      dining-room. Valentine instantly ran down. The doctor was a friend of the
      family, and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day, and very
      fond of Valentine, whose birth he had witnessed. He had himself a daughter
      about her age, but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear
      to him from her mother having been consumptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Valentine, “we have been waiting for you with
      such impatience, dear M. d’Avrigny. But, first of all, how are
      Madeleine and Antoinette?” Madeleine was the daughter of M. d’Avrigny,
      and Antoinette his niece. M. d’Avrigny smiled sadly. “Antoinette
      is very well,” he said, “and Madeleine tolerably so. But you
      sent for me, my dear child. It is not your father or Madame de Villefort
      who is ill. As for you, although we doctors cannot divest our patients of
      nerves, I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not
      to allow your imagination to take too wide a field.” Valentine
      colored. M. d’Avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a
      miraculous extent, for he was one of the physicians who always work upon
      the body through the mind. “No,” she replied, “it is for
      my poor grandmother. You know the calamity that has happened to us, do you
      not?”

    <p>
      “I know nothing.” said M. d’Avrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” said Valentine, restraining her tears, “my
      grandfather is dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Saint-Méran?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suddenly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From an apoplectic stroke.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An apoplectic stroke?” repeated the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband, whom she
      never left, has called her, and that she must go and join him. Oh, M. d’Avrigny,
      I beseech you, do something for her!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is she?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In her room with the notary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And M. Noirtier?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just as he was, his mind perfectly clear, but the same incapability
      of moving or speaking.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the same love for you—eh, my dear child?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Valentine, “he was very fond of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who does not love you?” Valentine smiled sadly. “What
      are your grandmother’s symptoms?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep; she
      fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her
      body, which she at the same time watched. It must have been delirium; she
      fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the
      noise it made on touching her glass.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is singular,” said the doctor; “I was not aware that
      Madame de Saint-Méran was subject to such hallucinations.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition,” said
      Valentine; “and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her
      mad; and my father, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself appeared
      deeply impressed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will go and see,” said the doctor; “what you tell me
      seems very strange.” The notary here descended, and Valentine was
      informed that her grandmother was alone. “Go upstairs,” she
      said to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I dare not—she forbade my sending for you; and, as you
      say, I am myself agitated, feverish and out of sorts. I will go and take a
      turn in the garden to recover myself.” The doctor pressed Valentine’s
      hand, and while he visited her grandmother, she descended the steps. We
      need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk. After
      remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house, and
      gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair, she turned into the dark
      avenue which led to the bench; then from the bench she went to the gate.
      As usual, Valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers, but
      without gathering them. The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming
      this simple ornament, though she had not yet had time to put on the
      outward semblance of woe. She then turned towards the avenue. As she
      advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name. She stopped
      astonished, then the voice reached her ear more distinctly, and she
      recognized it to be that of Maximilian.

    <h2>
      Chapter 73. The Promise
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was, indeed,
      Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence since the previous
      day. With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the
      return of Madame de Saint-Méran and the death of the marquis, that
      something would occur at M. de Villefort’s in connection with his
      attachment for Valentine. His presentiments were realized, as we shall
      see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the
      gate under the chestnut-trees. Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this
      sorrow and anxiety, and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting
      her, she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through
      sympathy. Morrel called her, and she ran to the gate. “You here at
      this hour?” said she. “Yes, my poor girl,” replied
      Morrel; “I come to bring and to hear bad tidings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is, indeed, a house of mourning,” said Valentine;
      “speak, Maximilian, although the cup of sorrow seems already full.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Valentine,” said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own
      emotion, “listen, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very
      serious. When are you to be married?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will tell you all,” said Valentine; “from you I have
      nothing to conceal. This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear
      grandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared
      herself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await
      the arrival of M. d’Epinay, and the following day the contract will
      be signed.” A deep sigh escaped the young man, who gazed long and
      mournfully at her he loved. “Alas,” replied he, “it is
      dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips. The sentence is
      passed, and, in a few hours, will be executed; it must be so, and I will
      not endeavor to prevent it. But, since you say nothing remains but for M.
      d’Epinay to arrive that the contract may be signed, and the
      following day you will be his, tomorrow you will be engaged to M. d’Epinay,
      for he came this morning to Paris.” Valentine uttered a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since,” said
      Morrel; “we were speaking, he of the sorrow your family had
      experienced, and I of your grief, when a carriage rolled into the
      courtyard. Never, till then, had I placed any confidence in presentiments,
      but now I cannot help believing them, Valentine. At the sound of that
      carriage I shuddered; soon I heard steps on the staircase, which terrified
      me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan. The door at
      last opened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears
      were vain, when, after him, another young man advanced, and the count
      exclaimed—‘Ah, here is the Baron Franz d’Epinay!’
      I summoned all my strength and courage to my support. Perhaps I turned
      pale and trembled, but certainly I smiled; and five minutes after I left,
      without having heard one word that had passed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor Maximilian!” murmured Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Valentine, the time has arrived when you must answer me. And
      remember my life depends on your answer. What do you intend doing?”
      Valentine held down her head; she was overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen,” said Morrel; “it is not the first time you
      have contemplated our present position, which is a serious and urgent one;
      I do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that
      for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in
      secret. There are such in the world, and God will doubtless reward them in
      heaven for their resignation on earth, but those who mean to contend must
      not lose one precious moment, but must return immediately the blow which
      fortune strikes. Do you intend to struggle against our ill-fortune? Tell
      me, Valentine for it is that I came to know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement. The idea of
      resisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never
      occurred to her. “What do you say, Maximilian?” asked
      Valentine. “What do you mean by a struggle? Oh, it would be a
      sacrilege. What? I resist my father’s order, and my dying
      grandmother’s wish? Impossible!” Morrel started. “You
      are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me so well that you
      already yield, dear Maximilian. No, no; I shall need all my strength to
      struggle with myself and support my grief in secret, as you say. But to
      grieve my father—to disturb my grandmother’s last moments—never!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right,” said Morrel, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what a tone you speak!” cried Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle,” cried Valentine; “mademoiselle! Oh,
      selfish man,—he sees me in despair, and pretends he cannot
      understand me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You mistake—I understand you perfectly. You will not oppose
      M. Villefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and tomorrow you
      will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, <i>mon Dieu!</i> tell me, how can I do otherwise?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not appeal to me, mademoiselle; I shall be a bad judge in such a
      case; my selfishness will blind me,” replied Morrel, whose low voice
      and clenched hands announced his growing desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would you have proposed, Maximilian, had you found me willing
      to accede?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not for me to say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are wrong; you must advise me what to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you seriously ask my advice, Valentine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it;
      you know my devotion to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Valentine,” said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank, “give
      me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused,
      and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through
      my brain. Oh, if you refuse my advice——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you advise?” said Valentine, raising her eyes to
      heaven and sighing. “I am free,” replied Maximilian, “and
      rich enough to support you. I swear to make you my lawful wife before my
      lips even shall have approached your forehead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You make me tremble!” said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Follow me,” said Morrel; “I will take you to my sister,
      who is worthy also to be yours. We will embark for Algiers, for England,
      for America, or, if you prefer it, retire to the country and only return
      to Paris when our friends have reconciled your family.” Valentine
      shook her head. “I feared it, Maximilian,” said she; “it
      is the counsel of a madman, and I should be more mad than you, did I not
      stop you at once with the word ‘Impossible, Morrel, impossible!’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even
      attempting to contend with it?” said Morrel sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,—if I die!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Valentine,” resumed Maximilian, “I can only say
      again that you are right. Truly, it is I who am mad, and you prove to me
      that passion blinds the most well-meaning. I appreciate your calm
      reasoning. It is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably
      promised to M. Franz d’Epinay, not only by that theatrical formality
      invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the
      contract, but your own will?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Again you drive me to despair, Maximilian,” said Valentine,
      “again you plunge the dagger into the wound! What would you do, tell
      me, if your sister listened to such a proposition?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle,” replied Morrel with a bitter smile, “I
      am selfish—you have already said so—and as a selfish man I
      think not of what others would do in my situation, but of what I intend
      doing myself. I think only that I have known you not a whole year. From
      the day I first saw you, all my hopes of happiness have been in securing
      your affection. One day you acknowledged that you loved me, and since that
      day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you, for to gain
      you would be life to me. Now, I think no more; I say only that fortune has
      turned against me—I had thought to gain heaven, and now I have lost
      it. It is an every-day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he
      possesses but also what he has not.” Morrel pronounced these words
      with perfect calmness; Valentine looked at him a moment with her large,
      scrutinizing eyes, endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which
      struggled in her heart. “But, in a word, what are you going to do?”
      asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you,
      mademoiselle, solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm,
      so happy, and so fully occupied, that there may be no place for me even in
      your memory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” murmured Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Adieu, Valentine, adieu!” said Morrel, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are you going?” cried the young girl, extending her
      hand through the opening, and seizing Maximilian by his coat, for she
      understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover’s calmness
      could not be real; “where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am going, that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family:
      and to set an example which every honest and devoted man, situated as I
      am, may follow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, Maximilian.”
      The young man smiled sorrowfully. “Speak, speak!” said
      Valentine; “I entreat you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has your resolution changed, Valentine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!” cried
      the young girl. “Then adieu, Valentine!” Valentine shook the
      gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be
      possessed, as Morrel was going away, and passing both her hands through
      the opening, she clasped and wrung them. “I must know what you mean
      to do!” said she. “Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, fear not,” said Maximilian, stopping at a short distance,
      “I do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous
      fate reserved for me. Another might threaten to seek M. Franz, to provoke
      him, and to fight with him; all that would be folly. What has M. Franz to
      do with it? He saw me this morning for the first time, and has already
      forgotten he has seen me. He did not even know I existed when it was
      arranged by your two families that you should be united. I have no enmity
      against M. Franz, and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On whom, then!—on me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On you? Valentine! Oh, heaven forbid! Woman is sacred; the woman
      one loves is holy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am the only guilty person, am I not?” said Maximilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maximilian!” said Valentine, “Maximilian, come back, I
      entreat you!” He drew near with his sweet smile, and but for his
      paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood. “Listen,
      my dear, my adored Valentine,” said he in his melodious and grave
      tone; “those who, like us, have never had a thought for which we
      need blush before the world, such may read each other’s hearts. I
      never was romantic, and am no melancholy hero. I imitate neither Manfred
      nor Anthony; but without words, protestations, or vows, my life has
      entwined itself with yours; you leave me, and you are right in doing so,—I
      repeat it, you are right; but in losing you, I lose my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The moment you leave me, Valentine, I am alone in the world. My
      sister is happily married; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is,
      a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me; no one then longer
      needs my useless life. This is what I shall do; I will wait until the very
      moment you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one of those
      unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M. Franz
      may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even on the
      altar as you approach it,—nothing appears impossible to one
      condemned to die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape
      from death is concerned. I will, then, wait until the last moment, and
      when my misery is certain, irremediable, hopeless, I will write a
      confidential letter to my brother-in-law, another to the prefect of
      police, to acquaint them with my intention, and at the corner of some
      wood, on the brink of some abyss, on the bank of some river, I will put an
      end to my existence, as certainly as I am the son of the most honest man
      who ever lived in France.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      Valentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her
      arms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks. The
      young man stood before her, sorrowful and resolute. “Oh, for pity’s
      sake,” said she, “you will live, will you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, on my honor,” said Maximilian; “but that will not
      affect you. You have done your duty, and your conscience will be at rest.”
      Valentine fell on her knees, and pressed her almost bursting heart.
      “Maximilian,” said she, “Maximilian, my friend, my
      brother on earth, my true husband in heaven, I entreat you, do as I do,
      live in suffering; perhaps we may one day be united.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Adieu, Valentine,” repeated Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My God,” said Valentine, raising both her hands to heaven
      with a sublime expression, “I have done my utmost to remain a
      submissive daughter; I have begged, entreated, implored; he has regarded
      neither my prayers, my entreaties, nor my tears. It is done,” cried
      she, wiping away her tears, and resuming her firmness, “I am
      resolved not to die of remorse, but rather of shame. Live, Maximilian, and
      I will be yours. Say when shall it be? Speak, command, I will obey.”
      Morrel, who had already gone some few steps away, again returned, and pale
      with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the opening.
      “Valentine,” said he, “dear Valentine, you must not
      speak thus—rather let me die. Why should I obtain you by violence,
      if our love is mutual? Is it from mere humanity you bid me live? I would
      then rather die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Truly,” murmured Valentine, “who on this earth cares
      for me, if he does not? Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he? On whom
      do my hopes rest? On whom does my bleeding heart repose? On him, on him,
      always on him! Yes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you. I will
      leave the paternal home, I will give up all. Oh, ungrateful girl that I
      am,” cried Valentine, sobbing, “I will give up all, even my
      dear old grandfather, whom I had nearly forgotten.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Maximilian, “you shall not leave him. M.
      Noirtier has evinced, you say, a kind feeling towards me. Well, before you
      leave, tell him all; his consent would be your justification in God’s
      sight. As soon as we are married, he shall come and live with us, instead
      of one child, he shall have two. You have told me how you talk to him and
      how he answers you; I shall very soon learn that language by signs,
      Valentine, and I promise you solemnly, that instead of despair, it is
      happiness that awaits us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, see, Maximilian, see the power you have over me, you almost
      make me believe you; and yet, what you tell me is madness, for my father
      will curse me—he is inflexible—he will never pardon me. Now
      listen to me, Maximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accident—in
      short, if by any means I can delay this marriage, will you wait?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this
      horrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged before
      a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world,
      namely, by my mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will wait, then,” said Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, we will wait,” replied Valentine, who revived at these
      words; “there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such
      as we are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I rely on you, Valentine,” said Morrel; “all you do
      will be well done; only if they disregard your prayers, if your father and
      Madame de Saint-Méran insist that M. d’Epinay should be called
      tomorrow to sign the contract——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you have my promise, Maximilian.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Instead of signing——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then,
      let us not tempt Providence, let us not see each other. It is a miracle,
      it is a providence that we have not been discovered. If we were surprised,
      if it were known that we met thus, we should have no further resource.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, Valentine; but how shall I ascertain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From the notary, M. Deschamps.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And for myself—I will write to you, depend on me. I dread
      this marriage, Maximilian, as much as you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you, my adored Valentine, thank you; that is enough. When
      once I know the hour, I will hasten to this spot, you can easily get over
      this fence with my assistance, a carriage will await us at the gate, in
      which you will accompany me to my sister’s; there living, retired or
      mingling in society, as you wish, we shall be enabled to use our power to
      resist oppression, and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep,
      which only defend themselves by sighs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Valentine, “I will now acknowledge you are
      right, Maximilian; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal?”
      said the young girl sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My adored Valentine, words cannot express one half of my
      satisfaction.” Valentine had approached, or rather, had placed her
      lips so near the fence, that they nearly touched those of Morrel, which
      were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier.
      “Adieu, then, till we meet again,” said Valentine, tearing
      herself away. “I shall hear from you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!” The sound of a kiss was
      heard, and Valentine fled through the avenue. Morrel listened to catch the
      last sound of her dress brushing the branches, and of her footstep on the
      gravel, then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to
      heaven for being permitted to be thus loved, and then also disappeared.
      The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next
      day without getting any message. It was only on the following day, at
      about ten o’clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M.
      Deschamps, the notary, that he received from the postman a small billet,
      which he knew to be from Valentine, although he had not before seen her
      writing. It was to this effect:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tears, entreaties, prayers, have availed me nothing. Yesterday, for
      two hours, I was at the church of Saint-Phillippe du Roule, and for two
      hours I prayed most fervently. Heaven is as inflexible as man, and the
      signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o’clock.
      I have but one promise and but one heart to give; that promise is pledged
      to you, that heart is also yours. This evening, then, at a quarter to nine
      at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your betrothed,
    </p>
    <p>
      “Valentine de Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “P.S.—My poor grandmother gets worse and worse; yesterday her
      fever amounted to delirium; today her delirium is almost madness. You will
      be very kind to me, will you not, Morrel, to make me forget my sorrow in
      leaving her thus? I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier,
      that the contract is to be signed this evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the contract
      was to be signed that evening. Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and
      heard still more. Franz had been to announce the ceremony, and Madame de
      Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting
      him; the death of M. de Saint-Méran and the dangerous illness of his widow
      would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be
      shared by the count whom she wished every happiness. The day before Franz
      had been presented to Madame de Saint-Méran, who had left her bed to
      receive him, but had been obliged to return to it immediately after. It is
      easy to suppose that Morrel’s agitation would not escape the count’s
      penetrating eye. Monte Cristo was more affectionate than ever,—indeed,
      his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the point of
      telling him all. But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine, and
      kept his secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man read Valentine’s letter twenty times in the course of
      the day. It was her first, and on what an occasion! Each time he read it
      he renewed his vow to make her happy. How great is the power of a woman
      who has made so courageous a resolution! What devotion does she deserve
      from him for whom she has sacrificed everything! How ought she really to
      be supremely loved! She becomes at once a queen and a wife, and it is
      impossible to thank and love her sufficiently. Morrel longed intensely for
      the moment when he should hear Valentine say, “Here I am,
      Maximilian; come and help me.” He had arranged everything for her
      escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field; a cabriolet was
      ordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant, without lights; at the
      turning of the first street they would light the lamps, as it would be
      foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions.
      Occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the moment when, from the top of
      that wall, he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine, pressing
      in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the
      delicate hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near, he
      wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question from a
      friend would have irritated him. He shut himself in his room, and tried to
      read, but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word, and
      he threw away the book, and for the second time sat down to sketch his
      plan, the ladders and the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the hour drew near. Never did a man deeply in love allow the
      clocks to go on peacefully. Morrel tormented his so effectually that they
      struck eight at half-past six. He then said, “It is time to start;
      the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o’clock, but
      perhaps Valentine will not wait for that.” Consequently, Morrel,
      having left the Rue Meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece, entered
      the clover-field while the clock of Saint-Phillippe du Roule was striking
      eight. The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin, where
      Morrel had often waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a
      deeper hue. Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating
      heart, and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet no
      one to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck half-past eight, and still another half-hour was passed
      in waiting, while Morrel walked to and fro, and gazed more and more
      frequently through the opening. The garden became darker still, but in the
      darkness he looked in vain for the white dress, and in the silence he
      vainly listened for the sound of footsteps. The house, which was
      discernible through the trees, remained in darkness, and gave no
      indication that so important an event as the signature of a
      marriage-contract was going on. Morrel looked at his watch, which wanted a
      quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or
      three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed. It was a
      terrible moment for the young man. The slightest rustling of the foliage,
      the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and drew the
      perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder, and, not
      to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step. Amidst all these
      alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten. “It is
      impossible,” said Maximilian, “that the signing of a contract
      should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions. I have
      weighed all the chances, calculated the time required for all the forms;
      something must have happened.” And then he walked rapidly to and
      fro, and pressed his burning forehead against the fence. Had Valentine
      fainted? or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight? These were
      the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and
      that she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most impressed
      itself upon his mind. “In that case,” said he, “I should
      lose her, and by my own fault.” He dwelt on this idea for a moment,
      then it appeared reality. He even thought he could perceive something on
      the ground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that
      the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the half-hour struck. It was impossible to wait longer, his
      temples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one leg
      over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side. He was on
      Villefort’s premises—had arrived there by scaling the wall.
      What might be the consequences? However, he had not ventured thus far to
      draw back. He followed a short distance close under the wall, then crossed
      a path, hid entered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed through
      them, and could see the house distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not
      illuminated. Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on days of
      ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a cloud, which
      at that moment obscured the moon’s feeble light. A light moved
      rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor. These
      three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran’s room. Another remained
      motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villefort’s
      bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order to follow
      Valentine in thought at every hour in the day, had he made her describe
      the whole house, that without having seen it he knew it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine’s
      absence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture
      everything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the
      misfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and
      was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden, when
      the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne upon the
      wind, reached him. At this sound, as he was already partially exposed to
      view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely, remaining
      perfectly motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak as
      she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he
      should see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he
      would listen to their conversation, and might understand something of this
      hitherto incomprehensible mystery. The moon had just then escaped from
      behind the cloud which had concealed it, and Morrel saw Villefort come out
      upon the steps, followed by a gentleman in black. They descended, and
      advanced towards the clump of trees, and Morrel soon recognized the other
      gentleman as Doctor d’Avrigny.

    <p>
      The young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he
      found himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump; there
      he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my dear doctor,” said the procureur, “heaven
      declares itself against my house! What a dreadful death—what a blow!
      Seek not to console me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow—the
      wound is too deep and too fresh! Dead, dead!” The cold sweat sprang
      to the young man’s brow, and his teeth chattered. Who could be dead
      in that house, which Villefort himself had called accursed? “My dear
      M. de Villefort,” replied the doctor, with a tone which redoubled
      the terror of the young man, “I have not led you here to console
      you; on the contrary——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What can you mean?” asked the procureur, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you,
      there is another, perhaps, still greater.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can it be possible?” murmured Villefort, clasping his hands.
      “What are you going to tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are we quite alone, my friend?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,” said
      the doctor. “Let us sit down.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort fell, rather than seated himself. The doctor stood before him,
      with one hand placed on his shoulder. Morrel, horrified, supported his
      head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its
      beatings should be heard. “Dead, dead!” repeated he within
      himself; and he felt as if he were also dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak, doctor—I am listening,” said Villefort; “strike—I
      am prepared for everything!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame de Saint-Méran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she
      enjoyed excellent health.” Morrel began again to breathe freely,
      which he had not done during the last ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Grief has consumed her,” said Villefort—“yes,
      grief, doctor! After living forty years with the marquis——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not grief, my dear Villefort,” said the doctor; “grief
      may kill, although it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour,
      never in ten minutes.” Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised
      his head, which had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were you present during the last struggle?” asked M. d’Avrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was,” replied the procureur; “you begged me not to
      leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de
      Saint-Méran has fallen a victim?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did. Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks, at
      intervals of some minutes, each one more serious than the former. When you
      arrived, Madame de Saint-Méran had already been panting for breath some
      minutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous attack,
      and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and her limbs and
      neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed. Then I understood
      from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought. This
      crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could not. You held her
      hand—you were feeling her pulse—and the second fit came on
      before you had turned towards me. This was more terrible than the first;
      the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth contracted and
      turned purple.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And at the third she expired.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus;
      you confirmed my opinion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, before others,” replied the doctor; “but now we
      are alone——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you going to say? Oh, spare me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances
      are the same.” M. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a
      moment fell down again, silent and motionless. Morrel knew not if he were
      dreaming or awake. “Listen,” said the doctor; “I know
      the full importance of the statement I have just made, and the disposition
      of the man to whom I have made it.”

    <p>
      “Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?” asked
      Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment. The similarity
      in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so
      great, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I
      should hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a magistrate,
      but to a friend. And to that friend I say, ‘During the
      three-quarters of an hour that the struggle continued, I watched the
      convulsions and the death of Madame de Saint-Méran, and am thoroughly
      convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison, but I could
      also specify the poison.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can it be possible?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The symptoms are marked, do you see?—sleep broken by nervous
      spasms, excitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres. Madame de
      Saint-Méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine,
      which by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.” Villefort
      seized the doctor’s hand. “Oh, it is impossible,” said
      he, “I must be dreaming! It is frightful to hear such things from
      such a man as you! Tell me, I entreat you, my dear doctor, that you may be
      deceived.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless I may, but——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But?”

    <p>
      “But I do not think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have pity on me doctor! So many dreadful things have happened to me
      lately that I am on the verge of madness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-Méran?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has anything been sent for from a chemist’s that I have not
      examined?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Had Madame de Saint-Méran any enemies?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not to my knowledge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would her death affect anyone’s interest?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress—Valentine
      alone. Oh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to
      punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, my dear friend,” said M. d’Avrigny, “I
      would not accuse anyone; I speak only of an accident, you understand,—of
      a mistake,—but whether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is
      on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you. Make inquiry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of whom?—how?—of what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have
      given Madame de Saint-Méran a dose prepared for his master?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For my father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de
      Saint-Méran?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing is more simple. You know poisons become remedies in certain
      diseases, of which paralysis is one. For instance, having tried every
      other remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved to
      try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him brucine;
      so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six grains. This
      quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of
      M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed to it, would be
      sufficient to kill another person.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear doctor, there is no communication between M. Noirtier’s
      apartment and that of Madame de Saint-Méran, and Barrois never entered my
      mother-in-law’s room. In short, doctor although I know you to be the
      most conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost
      reliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this
      axiom, <i>errare humanum est</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with
      myself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you ask me that?—what do you wish?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Send for him; I will tell him what I have seen, and we will consult
      together, and examine the body.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you will find traces of poison?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of
      the body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall
      say, ‘Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence,
      watch over your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you propose to me, d’Avrigny?” said Villefort
      in despair; “so soon as another is admitted into our secret, an
      inquest will become necessary; and an inquest in my house—impossible!
      Still,” continued the procureur, looking at the doctor with
      uneasiness, “if you wish it—if you demand it, why then it
      shall be done. But, doctor, you see me already so grieved—how can I
      introduce into my house so much scandal, after so much sorrow? My wife and
      my daughter would die of it! And I, doctor—you know a man does not
      arrive at the post I occupy—one has not been king’s attorney
      twenty-five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies;
      mine are numerous. Let this affair be talked of, it will be a triumph for
      them, which will make them rejoice, and cover me with shame. Pardon me,
      doctor, these worldly ideas; were you a priest I should not dare tell you
      that, but you are a man, and you know mankind. Doctor, pray recall your
      words; you have said nothing, have you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear M. de Villefort,” replied the doctor, “my first
      duty is to humanity. I would have saved Madame de Saint-Méran, if science
      could have done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living. Let us
      bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; I am
      willing, if anyone should suspect this, that my silence on the subject
      should be imputed to my ignorance. Meanwhile, sir, watch always—watch
      carefully, for perhaps the evil may not stop here. And when you have found
      the culprit, if you find him, I will say to you, ‘You are a
      magistrate, do as you will!’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you, doctor,” said Villefort with indescribable joy;
      “I never had a better friend than you.” And, as if he feared
      Doctor d’Avrigny would recall his promise, he hurried him towards
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the
      moon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken for
      that of a ghost. “I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but
      most terrible manner,” said he; “but Valentine, poor girl, how
      will she bear so much sorrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red curtains
      and the three windows with white curtains. The light had almost
      disappeared from the former; doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put
      out her lamp, and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the
      window. At the extremity of the building, on the contrary, he saw one of
      the three windows open. A wax-light placed on the mantle-piece threw some
      of its pale rays without, and a shadow was seen for one moment on the
      balcony. Morrel shuddered; he thought he heard a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but now
      disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was weakened
      even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts. Although it was
      impossible that Valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he thought he
      heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind told him so.
      This double error became an irresistible reality, and by one of the
      incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his hiding-place,
      and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the risk of alarming
      Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might
      escape the young girl, he crossed the flower-garden, which by the light of
      the moon resembled a large white lake, and having passed the rows of
      orange-trees which extended in front of the house, he reached the step,
      ran quickly up and pushed the door, which opened without offering any
      resistance. Valentine had not seen him. Her eyes, raised towards heaven,
      were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure, its form that of a
      shadow mounting towards heaven. Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as
      the soul of her grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase,
      which, being carpeted, prevented his approach being heard, and he had
      regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort
      even would not have alarmed him. He was quite prepared for any such
      encounter. He would at once approach Valentine’s father and
      acknowledge all, begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which
      united two fond and loving hearts. Morrel was mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily he did not meet anyone. Now, especially, did he find the
      description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to
      him; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase, and while he was
      feeling his way, a sob indicated the direction he was to take. He turned
      back, a door partly open enabled him to see his road, and to hear the
      voice of one in sorrow. He pushed the door open and entered. At the other
      end of the room, under a white sheet which covered it, lay the corpse,
      still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly
      overheard. By its side, on her knees, and with her head buried in the
      cushion of an easy-chair, was Valentine, trembling and sobbing, her hands
      extended above her head, clasped and stiff. She had turned from the
      window, which remained open, and was praying in accents that would have
      affected the most unfeeling; her words were rapid, incoherent,
      unintelligible, for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her
      utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn
      paler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene. Morrel could not
      resist this; he was not exemplary for piety, he was not easily impressed,
      but Valentine suffering, weeping, wringing her hands before him, was more
      than he could bear in silence. He sighed, and whispered a name, and the
      head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair—a
      head like that of a Magdalen by Correggio—was raised and turned
      towards him. Valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise.
      A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions.
      Morrel held out his hand to her. Valentine, as her only apology for not
      having met him, pointed to the corpse under the sheet, and began to sob
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither dared for some time to speak in that room. They hesitated to break
      the silence which death seemed to impose; at length Valentine ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” said she, “how came you here? Alas, I would
      say you are welcome, had not death opened the way for you into this house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Valentine,” said Morrel with a trembling voice, “I had
      waited since half-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy,
      leaped the wall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing
      about the fatal event——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What voices?” asked Valentine. Morrel shuddered as he thought
      of the conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he
      could see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the
      purple lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your servants,” said he, “who were repeating the whole
      of the sorrowful story; from them I learned it all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forgive me,” replied Morrel; “I will go away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Valentine, “you might meet someone; stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if anyone should come here——”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl shook her head. “No one will come,” said she;
      “do not fear, there is our safeguard,” pointing to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what has become of M. d’Epinay?” replied Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother
      was dying.”

    <p>
      “Alas,” said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he
      thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what redoubles my sorrow,” continued the young girl, as
      if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment, “is that
      the poor old lady, on her death-bed, requested that the marriage might
      take place as soon as possible; she also, thinking to protect me, was
      acting against me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hark!” said Morrel. They both listened; steps were distinctly
      heard in the corridor and on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is my father, who has just left his study.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To accompany the doctor to the door,” added Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do you know it is the doctor?” asked Valentine,
      astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I imagined it must be,” said Morrel. Valentine looked at the
      young man; they heard the street door close, then M. de Villefort locked
      the garden door, and returned upstairs. He stopped a moment in the
      anteroom, as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into
      Madame de Saint-Méran’s; Morrel concealed himself behind a door;
      Valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to deprive her of all fear.
      M. de Villefort passed on to his own room. “Now,” said
      Valentine, “you can neither go out by the front door nor by the
      garden.” Morrel looked at her with astonishment. “There is but
      one way left you that is safe,” said she; “it is through my
      grandfather’s room.” She rose, “Come,” she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?” asked Maximilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To my grandfather’s room.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I in M. Noirtier’s apartment?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can you mean it, Valentine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both
      need his help,—come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be careful, Valentine,” said Morrel, hesitating to comply
      with the young girl’s wishes; “I now see my error—I
      acted like a madman in coming in here. Are you sure you are more
      reasonable?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Valentine; “and I have but one scruple,—that
      of leaving my dear grandmother’s remains, which I had undertaken to
      watch.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Valentine,” said Morrel, “death is in itself sacred.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Valentine; “besides, it will not be for
      long.” She then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow
      staircase to M. Noirtier’s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at
      the door they found the old servant. “Barrois,” said
      Valentine, “shut the door, and let no one come in.” She passed
      first. Noirtier, seated in his chair, and listening to every sound, was
      watching the door; he saw Valentine, and his eye brightened. There was
      something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck
      the old man, and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate. “Dear
      grandfather.” said she hurriedly, “you know poor grandmamma
      died an hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.”
      His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness. “To you alone,
      then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?” The paralytic motioned
      “Yes.” Valentine took Maximilian’s hand. “Look
      attentively, then, at this gentleman.” The old man fixed his
      scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel. “It is M.
      Maximilian Morrel,” said she; “the son of that good merchant
      of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the old man. “He brings an irreproachable
      name, which Maximilian is likely to render glorious, since at thirty years
      of age he is a captain, an officer of the Legion of Honor.” The old
      man signified that he recollected him. “Well, grandpapa,” said
      Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing to Maximilian, “I love
      him, and will be only his; were I compelled to marry another, I would
      destroy myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.
      “You like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?” asked
      Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of
      my father?”—Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel, as
      if to say, “perhaps I may.” Maximilian understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle,” said he, “you have a sacred duty to
      fulfil in your deceased grandmother’s room, will you allow me the
      honor of a few minutes’ conversation with M. Noirtier?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is it,” said the old man’s eye. Then he looked
      anxiously at Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you fear he will not understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how I
      talk to you.” Then turning to Maximilian, with an adorable smile;
      although shaded by sorrow,—“He knows everything I know,”
      said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not to admit
      anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and sorrowfully
      taken leave of Morrel, she went away. To prove to Noirtier that he was in
      Valentine’s confidence and knew all their secrets, Morrel took the
      dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all on a table where
      there was a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But first,” said Morrel, “allow me, sir, to tell you
      who I am, how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs
      respecting her.” Noirtier made a sign that he would listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere
      useless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of the
      lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably noble
      and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with trembling.
      He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine,
      and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her solitude and her
      misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He told him his birth,
      his position, his fortune, and more than once, when he consulted the look
      of the paralytic, that look answered, “That is good, proceed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now,” said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of
      his recital, “now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I
      inform you of my intentions?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” signified the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in
      which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister’s house, to
      marry her, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort’s pardon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Noirtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We must not do so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not sanction our project?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is another way,” said Morrel. The old man’s
      interrogative eye said, “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will go,” continued Maximilian, “I will seek M. Franz
      d’Epinay—I am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle
      de Villefort’s absence—and will conduct myself toward him so
      as to compel him to challenge me.” Noirtier’s look continued
      to interrogate. “You wish to know what I will do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will find him, as I told you. I will tell him the ties which bind
      me to Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by
      renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure my
      friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through interest or
      ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would be forcing my
      wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no other, I will
      fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall kill him, or he will
      kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry Valentine, and if I die, I
      am very sure Valentine will not marry him.” Noirtier watched, with
      indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere countenance, on which every
      sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted, adding by the expression of his
      fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing.
      Still, when Morrel had finished, he shut his eyes several times, which was
      his manner of saying “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No?” said Morrel; “you disapprove of this second
      project, as you did of the first?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do,” signified the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what then must be done?” asked Morrel. “Madame de
      Saint-Méran’s last request was, that the marriage might not be
      delayed; must I let things take their course?” Noirtier did not
      move. “I understand,” said Morrel; “I am to wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But delay may ruin our plan, sir,” replied the young man.
      “Alone, Valentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit. I
      am here almost miraculously, and can scarcely hope for so good an
      opportunity to occur again. Believe me, there are only the two plans I
      have proposed to you; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer. Do
      you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you prefer I should seek M. d’Epinay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whence then will come the help we need—from chance?”
      resumed Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You thoroughly understand me, sir? Pardon my eagerness, for my life
      depends on your answer. Will our help come from you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are sure of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” There was so much firmness in the look which gave this
      answer, no one could, at any rate, doubt his will, if they did his power.
      “Oh, thank you a thousand times! But how, unless a miracle should
      restore your speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained to
      that armchair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?” A smile
      lit up the old man’s face, a strange smile of the eyes in a
      paralyzed face. “Then I must wait?” asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the contract?” The same smile returned. “Will you
      assure me it shall not be signed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Noirtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The contract shall not be signed!” cried Morrel. “Oh,
      pardon me, sir; I can scarcely realize so great a happiness. Will they not
      sign it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said the paralytic. Notwithstanding that assurance,
      Morrel still hesitated. This promise of an impotent old man was so strange
      that, instead of being the result of the power of his will, it might
      emanate from enfeebled organs. Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant
      of his folly, should attempt things beyond his power? The weak man talks
      of burdens he can raise, the timid of giants he can confront, the poor of
      treasures he spends, the most humble peasant, in the height of his pride,
      calls himself Jupiter. Whether Noirtier understood the young man’s
      indecision, or whether he had not full confidence in his docility, he
      looked uneasily at him. “What do you wish, sir?” asked Morrel;
      “that I should renew my promise of remaining tranquil?”
      Noirtier’s eye remained fixed and firm, as if to imply that a
      promise did not suffice; then it passed from his face to his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I swear to you, sir?” asked Maximilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the paralytic with the same solemnity. Morrel
      understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath. He
      extended his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I swear to you, on my honor,” said he, “to await your
      decision respecting the course I am to pursue with M. d’Epinay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is right,” said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Morrel, “do you wish me to retire?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey. “But,” said he,
      “first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now.”
      Noirtier’s expression could not be understood. The young man pressed
      his lips on the same spot, on the old man’s forehead, where
      Valentine’s had been. Then he bowed a second time and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found outside the door the old servant, to whom Valentine had given
      directions. Morrel was conducted along a dark passage, which led to a
      little door opening on the garden, soon found the spot where he had
      entered, with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall, and
      by his ladder was in an instant in the clover-field where his cabriolet
      was still waiting for him. He got in it, and thoroughly wearied by so many
      emotions, arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay, threw himself on his
      bed and slept soundly.

    <h2>
      Chapter 74. The Villefort Family Vault
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo days after, a
      considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o’clock in the
      morning, around the door of M. de Villefort’s house, and a long file
      of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg
      Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière. Among them was one of a very
      singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance. It was a kind
      of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first to arrive.
      Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange coincidence,
      this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de Saint-Méran, and that
      those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two. Their
      number was great. The Marquis de Saint-Méran, one of the most zealous and
      faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and King Charles X., had preserved a
      great number of friends, and these, added to the personages whom the
      usages of society gave Villefort a claim on, formed a considerable body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained that
      the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second hearse,
      decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de Villefort’s
      door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon. The two bodies
      were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, where M. de
      Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his
      family. The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there, and now,
      after ten years of separation, her father and mother were to be reunited
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display, looked
      on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to
      their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy—the
      greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp, Debray, and Château-Renaud were
      talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness. “I saw Madame
      de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles, when I was coming back from
      Algiers,” said Château-Renaud; “she looked like a woman
      destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent sound health
      and great activity of mind and body. How old was she?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Franz assured me,” replied Albert, “that she was
      sixty-six years old. But she has not died of old age, but of grief; it
      appears that since the death of the marquis, which affected her very
      deeply, she has not completely recovered her reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But of what disease, then, did she die?” asked Debray.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy,
      which is the same thing, is it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nearly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,” said
      Beauchamp. “Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of
      slender form, and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief
      could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de
      Saint-Méran.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At any rate,” said Albert, “whatever disease or doctor
      may have killed her, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,—or,
      still rather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting,
      I believe, to 80,000 livres per annum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin,
      Noirtier.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is a tenacious old grandfather,” said Beauchamp. “<i>Tenacem
      propositi virum</i>. I think he must have made an agreement with death to
      outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. He resembles the
      old Conventionalist of ‘93, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, ‘You
      bend because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth. Take
      the Republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to the
      battle-field, and I promise you 500,000 soldiers, another Marengo, and a
      second Austerlitz. Ideas do not become extinct, sire; they slumber
      sometimes, but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely.’
      Ideas and men appeared the same to him. One thing only puzzles me, namely,
      how Franz d’Epinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated
      from his wife. But where is Franz?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him
      already as one of the family.”
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages; these two sudden
      deaths, so quickly following each other, astonished everyone, but no one
      suspected the terrible secret which M. d’Avrigny had communicated,
      in his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort. They arrived in about an hour at
      the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with the
      funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault,
      Château-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a cabriolet, and
      walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees. “You here?”
      said Château-Renaud, passing his arms through the young captain’s;
      “are you a friend of Villefort’s? How is it that I have never
      met you at his house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort’s.” answered
      Morrel, “but I was of Madame de Saint-Méran.” Albert came up
      to them at this moment with Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.”
      said Albert; “but we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to
      present to you M. Franz d’Epinay, a delightful travelling companion,
      with whom I made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel,
      an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you
      will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit, or
      amiability.” Morrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be
      hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly
      opposing, but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to
      his memory; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?”
      said Debray to Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Extremely,” replied he; “she looked so pale this
      morning, I scarcely knew her.” These apparently simple words pierced
      Morrel to the heart. This man had seen Valentine, and spoken to her! The
      young and high-spirited officer required all his strength of mind to
      resist breaking his oath. He took the arm of Château-Renaud, and turned
      towards the vault, where the attendants had already placed the two
      coffins. “This is a magnificent habitation,” said Beauchamp,
      looking towards the mausoleum; “a summer and winter palace. You
      will, in turn, enter it, my dear d’Epinay, for you will soon be
      numbered as one of the family. I, as a philosopher, should like a little
      country-house, a cottage down there under the trees, without so many
      free-stones over my poor body. In dying, I will say to those around me
      what Voltaire wrote to Piron: ‘<i>Eo rus</i>, and all will be over.’
      But come, Franz, take courage, your wife is an heiress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, Beauchamp, you are unbearable. Politics has made you laugh
      at everything, and political men have made you disbelieve everything. But
      when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the pleasure
      of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your affectionate heart,
      which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber.”

      “But tell me,” said Beauchamp, “what is life? Is it not
      a halt in Death’s anteroom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am prejudiced against Beauchamp,” said Albert, drawing
      Franz away, and leaving the former to finish his philosophical
      dissertation with Debray. The Villefort vault formed a square of white
      stones, about twenty feet high; an interior partition separated the two
      families, and each apartment had its entrance door. Here were not, as in
      other tombs, ignoble drawers, one above another, where thrift bestows its
      dead and labels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible
      within the bronze gates was a gloomy-looking room, separated by a wall
      from the vault itself. The two doors before mentioned were in the middle
      of this wall, and enclosed the Villefort and Saint-Méran coffins. There
      grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling
      loungers who came from a picnic party to visit Père-Lachaise, or by lovers
      who make it their rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their
      reception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the Saint-Méran family.
      Villefort, Franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door, and there
      was no address given, the party all separated; Château-Renaud, Albert, and
      Morrel, went one way, and Debray and Beauchamp the other. Franz remained
      with M. de Villefort; at the gate of the cemetery, Morrel made an excuse
      to wait; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the same mourning
      coach, and thought this meeting forboded evil. He then returned to Paris,
      and although in the same carriage with Château-Renaud and Albert, he did
      not hear one word of their conversation. As Franz was about to take leave
      of M. de Villefort, “When shall I see you again?” said the
      latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At what time you please, sir,” replied Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As soon as possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am at your command, sir; shall we return together?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If not unpleasant to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary, I shall feel much pleasure.” Thus, the
      future father and son-in-law stepped into the same carriage, and Morrel,
      seeing them pass, became uneasy. Villefort and Franz returned to the
      Faubourg Saint-Honoré. The procureur, without going to see either his wife
      or his daughter, went at once to his study, and, offering the young man a
      chair,—“M. d’Epinay,” said he, “allow me to
      remind you at this moment,—which is perhaps not so ill-chosen as at
      first sight may appear, for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the
      first offering which should be made at their tomb,—allow me then to
      remind you of the wish expressed by Madame de Saint-Méran on her
      death-bed, that Valentine’s wedding might not be deferred. You know
      the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order, and her will bequeaths
      to Valentine the entire property of the Saint-Méran family; the notary
      showed me the documents yesterday, which will enable us to draw up the
      contract immediately. You may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place
      Beauveau, Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and you have my authority to inspect
      those deeds.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” replied M. d’Epinay, “it is not, perhaps,
      the moment for Mademoiselle Valentine, who is in deep distress, to think
      of a husband; indeed, I fear——”

      “Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her
      grandmother’s last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that
      quarter, I assure you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case,” replied Franz, “as I shall raise none,
      you may make arrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and
      shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Villefort, “nothing further is required.
      The contract was to have been signed three days since; we shall find it
      all ready, and can sign it today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the mourning?” said Franz, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t be uneasy on that score,” replied Villefort;
      “no ceremony will be neglected in my house. Mademoiselle de
      Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of
      Saint-Méran; I say hers, for she inherits it today. There, after a few
      days, if you like, the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or
      ceremony. Madame de Saint-Méran wished her daughter should be married
      there. When that is over, you, sir, can return to Paris, while your wife
      passes the time of her mourning with her mother-in-law.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you please, sir,” said Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” replied M. de Villefort, “have the kindness to
      wait half an hour; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room. I will
      send for M. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we
      separate, and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine
      to her estate, where we will rejoin them in a week.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Franz, “I have one request to make.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Château-Renaud to be present
      at this signature; you know they are my witnesses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Half an hour will suffice to apprise them; will you go for them
      yourself, or shall you send?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I prefer going, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine
      will be ready.” Franz bowed and left the room. Scarcely had the door
      closed, when M. de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the
      drawing-room in half an hour, as he expected the notary and M. d’Epinay
      and his witnesses. The news caused a great sensation throughout the house;
      Madame de Villefort would not believe it, and Valentine was thunderstruck.
      She looked around for help, and would have gone down to her grandfather’s
      room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort, who took her arm and led
      her into the drawing-room. In the anteroom, Valentine met Barrois, and
      looked despairingly at the old servant. A moment later, Madame de
      Villefort entered the drawing-room with her little Edward. It was evident
      that she had shared the grief of the family, for she was pale and looked
      fatigued. She sat down, took Edward on her knees, and from time to time
      pressed this child, on whom her affections appeared centred, almost
      convulsively to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard. One was the notary’s;
      the other, that of Franz and his friends. In a moment the whole party was
      assembled. Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her
      temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks. Franz was deeply affected.
      Château-Renaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement; the
      ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did
      that which was about to begin. Madame de Villefort had placed herself in
      the shadow behind a velvet curtain, and as she constantly bent over her
      child, it was difficult to read the expression of her face. M. de
      Villefort was, as usual, unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary, after having, according to the customary method, arranged the
      papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his
      spectacles, turned towards Franz:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d’Epinay?” asked he,
      although he knew it perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” replied Franz. The notary bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have, then, to inform you, sir, at the request of M. de
      Villefort, that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has
      changed the feeling of M. Noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he
      disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her. Let me
      hasten to add,” continued he, “that the testator, having only
      the right to alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all,
      the will will not bear scrutiny, and is declared null and void.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” said Villefort; “but I warn M. d’Epinay,
      that during my life-time my father’s will shall never be questioned,
      my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Franz, “I regret much that such a question
      has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine; I have never
      inquired the amount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be,
      exceeds mine. My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M.
      de Villefort; all I seek is happiness.” Valentine imperceptibly
      thanked him, while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks. “Besides,
      sir,” said Villefort, addressing himself to his future son-in-law,
      “excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes, this unexpected will
      need not personally wound you; M. Noirtier’s weakness of mind
      sufficiently explains it. It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is
      going to marry you that he is angry, but because she will marry, a union
      with any other would have caused him the same sorrow. Old age is selfish,
      sir, and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M.
      Noirtier, which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness d’Epinay.
      My father’s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any
      subjects, which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from
      understanding, and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time,
      although, he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married, M.
      Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson.” M.
      de Villefort had scarcely said this, when the door opened, and Barrois
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen,” said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant
      speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances,—“gentlemen,
      M. Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de
      Quesnel, baron d’Epinay;” he, as well as the notary, that
      there might be no mistake in the person, gave all his titles to the
      bridegroom elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees,
      Valentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. Albert and Château-Renaud
      exchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. The notary
      looked at Villefort. “It is impossible,” said the procureur.
      “M. d’Epinay cannot leave the drawing-room at present.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is at this moment,” replied Barrois with the same
      firmness, “that M. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important
      subjects to M. Franz d’Epinay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,” said Edward, with
      his habitual quickness. However, his remark did not make Madame de
      Villefort even smile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was
      the situation. Astonishment was at its height. Something like a smile was
      perceptible on Madame de Villefort’s countenance. Valentine
      instinctively raised her eyes, as if to thank heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray go, Valentine,” said; M. de Villefort, “and see
      what this new fancy of your grandfather’s is.” Valentine rose
      quickly, and was hastening joyfully towards the door, when M. de Villefort
      altered his intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop,” said he; “I will go with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse me, sir,” said Franz, “since M. Noirtier sent
      for me, I am ready to attend to his wish; besides, I shall be happy to pay
      my respects to him, not having yet had the honor of doing so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray, sir,” said Villefort with marked uneasiness, “do
      not disturb yourself.”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Forgive me, sir,” said Franz in a resolute tone. “I
      would not lose this opportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong it
      would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me, which I am
      determined to conquer, whatever they may be, by my devotion.” And
      without listening to Villefort he arose, and followed Valentine, who was
      running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock
      to cling to. M. de Villefort followed them. Château-Renaud and Morcerf
      exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>oirtier was
      prepared to receive them, dressed in black, and installed in his armchair.
      When the three persons he expected had entered, he looked at the door,
      which his valet immediately closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen,” whispered Villefort to Valentine, who could not
      conceal her joy; “if M. Noirtier wishes to communicate anything
      which would delay your marriage, I forbid you to understand him.”
      Valentine blushed, but did not answer. Villefort, approaching Noirtier—“Here
      is M. Franz d’Epinay,” said he; “you requested to see
      him. We have all wished for this interview, and I trust it will convince
      you how ill-formed are your objections to Valentine’s marriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort’s blood run
      cold. He motioned to Valentine to approach. In a moment, thanks to her
      habit of conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for
      a key. Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the
      windows. She opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding that
      was what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an old
      secretary which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to
      contain nothing but useless documents. “Shall I open the secretary
      desk?” asked Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the drawers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those at the side?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The middle one?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers.
      “Is that what you wish for?” asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty.
      “But there are no more,” said she. Noirtier’s eye was
      fixed on the dictionary. “Yes, I understand, grandfather,”
      said the young girl.

      She pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man
      stopped her. She opened, and found the word “secret.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, is there a secret spring?” said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Noirtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who knows it?” Noirtier looked at the door where the
      servant had gone out. “Barrois?” said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I call him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort’s
      impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead,
      and Franz was stupefied. The old servant came. “Barrois,” said
      Valentine, “my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the
      secretary desk, but there is a secret spring in it, which you know—will
      you open it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrois looked at the old man. “Obey,” said Noirtier’s
      intelligent eye. Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and
      they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that what you wish for?” said Barrois.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Mademoiselle Valentine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To M. Franz d’Epinay?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz, astonished, advanced a step. “To me, sir?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at
      the cover, read:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall
      bequeath the packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as
      containing an important document.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir,” asked Franz, “what do you wish me to do
      with this paper?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,” said the
      procureur.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Noirtier eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you wish him to read it?” said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the old man. “You understand, baron, my
      grandfather wishes you to read this paper,” said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then let us sit down,” said Villefort impatiently, “for
      it will take some time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sit down,” said the old man. Villefort took a chair, but
      Valentine remained standing by her father’s side, and Franz before
      him, holding the mysterious paper in his hand. “Read,” said
      the old man. Franz untied it, and in the midst of the most profound
      silence read:

      Quesnel, who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to
      be devoted to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty, notwithstanding the
      title of baron which Louis XVIII. had just granted to him with his estate
      of Epinay.

      “‘A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel,
      begging him to be present at the meeting next day, the 5th. The note
      indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting
      was to be held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that
      someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o’clock. The
      meetings were always held from that time till midnight. At nine o’clock
      the president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the
      president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was
      that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and that he
      would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would not endeavor
      to take off the bandage. General de Quesnel accepted the condition, and
      promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took. The
      general’s carriage was ready, but the president told him it was
      impossible for him to use it, since it was useless to blindfold the master
      if the coachman knew through what streets he went. “What must be
      done then?” asked the general.—“I have my carriage here,”
      said the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Have you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you
      can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Our coachman is a member of the club,” said the
      president; “we shall be driven by a State-Councillor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Then we run another risk,” said the general,
      laughing, “that of being upset.” We insert this joke to prove
      that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting, but
      that he came willingly. When they were seated in the carriage the
      president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be
      bandaged, to which he made no opposition. On the road the president
      thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief, and
      reminded him of his oath. “Sure enough,” said the general. The
      carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques. The
      general alighted, leaning on the arm of the president, of whose dignity he
      was not aware, considering him simply as a member of the club; they went
      through the alley, mounted a flight of stairs, and entered the
      assembly-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The deliberations had already begun. The members, apprised
      of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in
      attendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to
      remove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so
      many well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then
      been ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he contented
      himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of Elba ought to
      have informed them’”—
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz interrupted himself by saying, “My father was a royalist; they
      need not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And hence,” said Villefort, “arose my affection for
      your father, my dear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of
      union.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Read again,” said the old man. Franz continued:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly,
      but M. de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted
      with him. He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the
      Island of Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would
      be likely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of
      the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details,
      on the arrival of the <i>Pharaon</i> belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel,
      of Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor. During
      all this time, the general, on whom they thought to have relied as on a
      brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance. When the
      reading was finished, he remained silent, with knitted brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Well,” asked the president, “what do you say to
      this letter, general?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis
      XVIII. to break my vow in behalf of the ex-emperor.” This answer was
      too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments. “General,”
      said the president, “we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII., or an
      ex-emperor, but his majesty the emperor and king, driven from France,
      which is his kingdom, by violence and treason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Excuse me, gentlemen,” said the general; “you
      may not acknowledge Louis XVIII., but I do, as he has made me a baron and
      a field-marshal, and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am
      indebted to his happy return to France.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Sir,” said the president, rising with gravity,
      “be careful what you say; your words clearly show us that they are
      deceived concerning you in the Island of Elba, and have deceived us! The
      communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed
      in you, and which does you honor. Now we discover our error; a title and
      promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn. We will not
      constrain you to help us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we
      will compel you to act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"You would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy
      and not informing against you, that is what I should call becoming your
      accomplice. You see I am more candid than you.”’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my father!” said Franz, interrupting himself. “I
      understand now why they murdered him.” Valentine could not help
      casting one glance towards the young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was
      delightful to behold. Villefort walked to and fro behind them. Noirtier
      watched the expression of each one, and preserved his dignified and
      commanding attitude. Franz returned to the manuscript, and continued:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Sir,” said the president, “you have been
      invited to join this assembly—you were not forced here; it was
      proposed to you to come blindfolded—you accepted. When you complied
      with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the
      throne of Louis XVIII., or we should not take so much care to avoid the
      vigilance of the police. It would be conceding too much to allow you to
      put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret, and then to
      remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you. No, no, you
      must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now
      reigns, or for his majesty the emperor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"I am a royalist,” replied the general; “I have
      taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XVIII., and I will adhere to it.”
      These words were followed by a general murmur, and it was evident that
      several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general
      repent of his rashness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The president again arose, and having imposed silence, said,—“Sir,
      you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the
      consequences of our present situation, and your candor has already
      dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you.” The
      general, putting his hand on his sword, exclaimed,—“If you
      talk of honor, do not begin by disavowing its laws, and impose nothing by
      violence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"And you, sir,” continued the president, with a
      calmness still more terrible than the general’s anger, “I
      advise you not to touch your sword.” The general looked around him
      with slight uneasiness; however he did not yield, but calling up all his
      fortitude, said,—“I will not swear.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Then you must die,” replied the president calmly. M.
      d’Epinay became very pale; he looked round him a second time,
      several members of the club were whispering, and getting their arms from
      under their cloaks. “General,” said the president, “do
      not alarm yourself; you are among men of honor who will use every means to
      convince you before resorting to the last extremity, but as you have said,
      you are among conspirators, you are in possession of our secret, and you
      must restore it to us.” A significant silence followed these words,
      and as the general did not reply,—“Close the doors,”
      said the president to the door-keeper.

    <p>
      “‘The same deadly silence succeeded these words. Then the
      general advanced, and making a violent effort to control his feelings,—“I
      have a son,” said he, “and I ought to think of him, finding
      myself among assassins.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"General,” said the chief of the assembly, “one
      man may insult fifty—it is the privilege of weakness. But he does
      wrong to use his privilege. Follow my advice, swear, and do not insult.”
      The general, again daunted by the superiority of the chief, hesitated a
      moment; then advancing to the president’s desk,—“What is
      the form, said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"It is this:—‘I swear by my honor not to reveal
      to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February, 1815, between
      nine and ten o’clock in the evening; and I plead guilty of death
      should I ever violate this oath.’” The general appeared to be
      affected by a nervous tremor, which prevented his answering for some
      moments; then, overcoming his manifest repugnance, he pronounced the
      required oath, but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the
      majority of the members, who insisted on his repeating it clearly and
      distinctly, which he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Now am I at liberty to retire?” said the general. The
      president rose, appointed three members to accompany him, and got into the
      carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes. One of those three
      members was the coachman who had driven them there. The other members
      silently dispersed. “Where do you wish to be taken?” asked the
      president.—“Anywhere out of your presence,” replied M. d’Epinay.
      “Beware, sir,” replied the president, “you are no longer
      in the assembly, and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them
      unless you wish to be held responsible.” But instead of listening,
      M. d’Epinay went on,—“You are still as brave in your
      carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one.”
      The president stopped the coach. They were at that part of the Quai des
      Ormes where the steps lead down to the river. “Why do you stop here?”
      asked d’Epinay.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Because, sir,” said the president, “you have
      insulted a man, and that man will not go one step farther without
      demanding honorable reparation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Another method of assassination?” said the general,
      shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘"Make no noise, sir, unless you wish me to consider you as
      one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards, who take their
      weakness for a shield. You are alone, one alone shall answer you; you have
      a sword by your side, I have one in my cane; you have no witness, one of
      these gentlemen will serve you. Now, if you please, remove your bandage.”
      The general tore the handkerchief from his eyes. “At last,”
      said he, “I shall know with whom I have to do.” They opened
      the door and the four men alighted.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his brow;
      there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling
      pallor these details of his father’s death, which had hitherto been
      a mystery. Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer. Noirtier looked at
      Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride. Franz
      continued:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘It was, as we said, the fifth of February. For three days
      the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were
      covered with ice. The general was stout and tall, the president offered
      him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down. The two
      witnesses followed. It was a dark night. The ground from the steps to the
      river was covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked
      black and deep. One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge
      near, and by its light they examined the weapons. The president’s
      sword, which was simply, as he had said, one he carried in his cane, was
      five inches shorter than the general’s, and had no guard. The
      general proposed to cast lots for the swords, but the president said it
      was he who had given the provocation, and when he had given it he had
      supposed each would use his own arms. The witnesses endeavored to insist,
      but the president bade them be silent. The lantern was placed on the
      ground, the two adversaries took their stations, and the duel began. The
      light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning; as for the
      men, they were scarcely perceptible, the darkness was so great.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “‘General d’Epinay passed for one of the best swordsmen
      in the army, but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his
      aim and fell. The witnesses thought he was dead, but his adversary, who
      knew he had not struck him, offered him the assistance of his hand to
      rise. The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general, and he
      rushed on his adversary. But his opponent did not allow his guard to be
      broken. He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back
      on finding himself too closely engaged, and then returned to the charge.
      At the third he fell again. They thought he slipped, as at first, and the
      witnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to raise him,
      but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with
      blood. The general, who had almost fainted, revived. “Ah,”
      said he, “they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.”
      The president, without answering, approached the witness who held the
      lantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received in
      his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat, displayed
      his side, pierced with a third wound. Still he had not even uttered a
      sigh. General d’Epinay died five minutes after.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly
      audible, and then stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel
      a cloud; but after a moment’s silence, he continued:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The president went up the steps, after pushing his sword
      into his cane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course. He had
      scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water—it
      was the general’s body, which the witnesses had just thrown into the
      river after ascertaining that he was dead. The general fell, then, in a
      loyal duel, and not in ambush as it might have been reported. In proof of
      this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts, lest
      the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene
      should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of
      honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Signed, Beaurepaire, Duchampy, and Lecharpal.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a son; when
      Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when Villefort,
      trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to lessen the storm by
      supplicating glances at the implacable old man,—“Sir,”
      said d’Epinay to Noirtier, “since you are well acquainted with
      all these details, which are attested by honorable signatures,—since
      you appear to take some interest in me, although you have only manifested
      it hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final satisfaction—tell
      me the name of the president of the club, that I may at least know who
      killed my father.” Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the
      door; Valentine, who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather’s
      answer, and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm, drew back a
      few steps. “Mademoiselle,” said Franz, turning towards
      Valentine, “unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the
      man who made me an orphan at two years of age.” Valentine remained
      dumb and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hold, sir,” said Villefort, “do not prolong this
      dreadful scene. The names have been purposely concealed; my father himself
      does not know who this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you;
      proper names are not in the dictionary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, misery,” cried Franz: “the only hope which
      sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing, at
      least, the name of him who killed my father! Sir, sir,” cried he,
      turning to Noirtier, “do what you can—make me understand in
      some way!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Noirtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, mademoiselle,—mademoiselle!” cried Franz, “your
      grandfather says he can indicate the person. Help me,—lend me your
      assistance!” Noirtier looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a
      nervous trembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively,
      until he came to M. At that letter the old man signified “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M,” repeated Franz. The young man’s finger, glided over
      the words, but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine
      hid her head between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word
      MYSELF.

      “Yes!” replied Noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young
      man. Franz fell powerless on a chair; Villefort opened the door and
      escaped, for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining
      life in the heart of this terrible old man.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>eanwhile M.
      Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in the army of his
      majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table of the baths of
      Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers. He had spent
      every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the
      majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed
      character of father.

      M. Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he
      had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the
      Marchioness Oliva Corsinari. He was now fairly launched in that Parisian
      society which gives such ready access to foreigners, and treats them, not
      as they really are, but as they wish to be considered. Besides, what is
      required of a young man in Paris? To speak its language tolerably, to make
      a good appearance, to be a good gamester, and to pay in cash. They are
      certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a Frenchman. Andrea
      had, then, in a fortnight, attained a very fair position. He was called
      count, he was said to possess 50,000 livres per annum; and his father’s
      immense riches, buried in the quarries of Saravezza, were a constant
      theme. A learned man, before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a
      fact, declared he had seen the quarries in question, which gave great
      weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful, but which now assumed the
      garb of reality.

    <p>
      Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our
      readers, when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M. Danglars a visit. M.
      Danglars was out, but the count was asked to go and see the baroness, and
      he accepted the invitation. It was never without a nervous shudder, since
      the dinner at Auteuil, and the events which followed it, that Madame
      Danglars heard Monte Cristo’s name announced. If he did not come,
      the painful sensation became most intense; if, on the contrary, he
      appeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes, his amiability, his
      polite attention even towards Madame Danglars, soon dispelled every
      impression of fear. It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of
      such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against
      her; besides, the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would
      answer some interested end—useless injury is repugnant to every
      mind. When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir, to which we have already once
      introduced our readers, and where the baroness was examining some
      drawings, which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them
      with M. Cavalcanti, his presence soon produced its usual effect, and it
      was with smiles that the baroness received the count, although she had
      been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name. The latter
      took in the whole scene at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa, Eugénie sat near her, and
      Cavalcanti was standing. Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one of Goethe’s
      heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked stockings, passed
      a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his light hair, and so
      displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of Monte Cristo’s
      advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little
      finger. This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle
      Danglars, and by sighs launched in the same direction. Mademoiselle
      Danglars was still the same—cold, beautiful, and satirical. Not one
      of these glances, nor one sigh, was lost on her; they might have been said
      to fall on the shield of Minerva, which some philosophers assert protected
      sometimes the breast of Sappho. Eugénie bowed coldly to the count, and
      availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest
      to escape to her study, whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices
      being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured Monte
      Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars preferred to his society and to that of
      M. Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly, her
      singing teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then, especially while conversing with Madame Danglars, and
      apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count
      noticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti’s solicitude, his manner of listening
      to the music at the door he dared not pass, and of manifesting his
      admiration. The banker soon returned. His first look was certainly
      directed towards Monte Cristo, but the second was for Andrea. As for his
      wife, he bowed to her, as some husbands do to their wives, but in a way
      that bachelors will never comprehend, until a very extensive code is
      published on conjugal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?”
      said Danglars to Andrea. “Alas, no, sir,” replied Andrea with
      a sigh, still more remarkable than the former ones. Danglars immediately
      advanced towards the door and opened it.

    </h5>
    <p>
      The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair, at the piano,
      accompanying themselves, each with one hand, a fancy to which they had
      accustomed themselves, and performed admirably. Mademoiselle d’Armilly,
      whom they then perceived through the open doorway, formed with Eugénie one
      of the <i>tableaux vivants</i> of which the Germans are so fond. She was
      somewhat beautiful, and exquisitely formed—a little fairy-like
      figure, with large curls falling on her neck, which was rather too long,
      as Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins, and her eyes dull from fatigue.
      She was said to have a weak chest, and like Antonia in the <i>Cremona
      Violin</i>, she would die one day while singing. Monte Cristo cast one
      rapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it was the first time he had
      ever seen Mademoiselle d’Armilly, of whom he had heard much. “Well,”
      said the banker to his daughter, “are we then all to be excluded?”
      He then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or manœuvre
      the door was partially closed after Andrea, so that from the place where
      they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything; but as the
      banker had accompanied Andrea, Madame Danglars appeared to take no notice
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count soon heard Andrea’s voice, singing a Corsican song,
      accompanied by the piano. While the count smiled at hearing this song,
      which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto,
      Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband’s
      strength of mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred
      thousand francs by a failure at Milan. The praise was well deserved, for
      had not the count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by
      which he knew everything, the baron’s countenance would not have led
      him to suspect it. “Hem,” thought Monte Cristo, “he
      begins to conceal his losses; a month since he boasted of them.”
      Then aloud,—“Oh, madame, M. Danglars is so skilful, he will
      soon regain at the Bourse what he loses elsewhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see that you participate in a prevalent error,” said Madame
      Danglars. “What is it?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That M. Danglars speculates, whereas he never does.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Truly, madame, I recollect M. Debray told me—apropos, what
      has become of him? I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nor I,” said Madame Danglars; “but you began a
      sentence, sir, and did not finish.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Debray had told you——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of
      speculation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was once very fond of it, but I do not indulge now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you are wrong, madame. Fortune is precarious; and if I were a
      woman and fate had made me a banker’s wife, whatever might be my
      confidence in my husband’s good fortune, still in speculation you
      know there is great risk. Well, I would secure for myself a fortune
      independent of him, even if I acquired it by placing my interests in hands
      unknown to him.” Madame Danglars blushed, in spite of all her
      efforts. “Stay,” said Monte Cristo, as though he had not
      observed her confusion, “I have heard of a lucky hit that was made
      yesterday on the Neapolitan bonds.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have none—nor have I ever possessed any; but really we have
      talked long enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you
      heard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What has happened?” said the count, simulating total
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know the Marquis of Saint-Méran died a few days after he had
      set out on his journey to Paris, and the marchioness a few days after her
      arrival?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “I have heard that; but, as
      Claudius said to Hamlet, ‘it is a law of nature; their fathers died
      before them, and they mourned their loss; they will die before their
      children, who will, in their turn, grieve for them.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But that is not all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not all!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; they were going to marry their daughter——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To M. Franz d’Epinay. Is it broken off?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yesterday morning, it appears, Franz declined the honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed? And is the reason known?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How extraordinary! And how does M. de Villefort bear it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As usual. Like a philosopher.” Danglars returned at this
      moment alone. “Well,” said the baroness, “do you leave
      M. Cavalcanti with your daughter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And Mademoiselle d’Armilly,” said the banker; “do
      you consider her no one?” Then, turning to Monte Cristo, he said,
      “Prince Cavalcanti is a charming young man, is he not? But is he
      really a prince?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will not answer for it,” said Monte Cristo. “His
      father was introduced to me as a marquis, so he ought to be a count; but I
      do not think he has much claim to that title.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?” said the banker. “If he is a prince, he is wrong
      not to maintain his rank; I do not like anyone to deny his origin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you are a thorough democrat,” said Monte Cristo, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But do you see to what you are exposing yourself?” said the
      baroness. “If, perchance, M. de Morcerf came, he would find M.
      Cavalcanti in that room, where he, the betrothed of Eugénie, has never
      been admitted.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may well say, perchance,” replied the banker; “for
      he comes so seldom, it would seem only chance that brings him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But should he come and find that young man with your daughter, he
      might be displeased.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He? You are mistaken. M. Albert would not do us the honor to be
      jealous; he does not like Eugénie sufficiently. Besides, I care not for
      his displeasure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still, situated as we are——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, do you know how we are situated? At his mother’s ball he
      danced once with Eugénie, and M. Cavalcanti three times, and he took no
      notice of it.” The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.
      The baroness rose hastily, and was going into the study, when Danglars
      stopped her. “Let her alone,” said he. She looked at him in
      amazement. Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed. Albert
      entered, looking very handsome and in high spirits. He bowed politely to
      the baroness, familiarly to Danglars, and affectionately to Monte Cristo.
      Then turning to the baroness: “May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars
      is?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is quite well,” replied Danglars quickly; “she is
      at the piano with M. Cavalcanti.” Albert retained his calm and
      indifferent manner; he might feel perhaps annoyed, but he knew Monte
      Cristo’s eye was on him. “M. Cavalcanti has a fine tenor
      voice,” said he, “and Mademoiselle Eugénie a splendid soprano,
      and then she plays the piano like Thalberg. The concert must be a
      delightful one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They suit each other remarkably well,” said Danglars. Albert
      appeared not to notice this remark, which was, however, so rude that
      Madame Danglars blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I, too,” said the young man, “am a musician—at
      least, my masters used to tell me so; but it is strange that my voice
      never would suit any other, and a soprano less than any.” Danglars
      smiled, and seemed to say, “It is of no consequence.” Then,
      hoping doubtless to effect his purpose, he said,—“The prince
      and my daughter were universally admired yesterday. You were not of the
      party, M. de Morcerf?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What prince?” asked Albert. “Prince Cavalcanti,”
      said Danglars, who persisted in giving the young man that title.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pardon me,” said Albert, “I was not aware that he was a
      prince. And Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugénie yesterday? It
      must have been charming, indeed. I regret not having heard them. But I was
      unable to accept your invitation, having promised to accompany my mother
      to a German concert given by the Baroness of Château-Renaud.” This
      was followed by rather an awkward silence. “May I also be allowed,”
      said Morcerf, “to pay my respects to Mademoiselle Danglars?”
      “Wait a moment,” said the banker, stopping the young man;
      “do you hear that delightful cavatina? Ta, ta, ta, ti, ta, ti, ta,
      ta; it is charming, let them finish—one moment. Bravo, bravi, brava!”
      The banker was enthusiastic in his applause.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Indeed,” said Albert, “it is exquisite; it is
      impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince
      Cavalcanti does. You said prince, did you not? But he can easily become
      one, if he is not already; it is no uncommon thing in Italy. But to return
      to the charming musicians—you should give us a treat, Danglars,
      without telling them there is a stranger. Ask them to sing one more song;
      it is so delightful to hear music in the distance, when the musicians are
      unrestrained by observation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars was quite annoyed by the young man’s indifference. He took
      Monte Cristo aside. “What do you think of our lover?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He appears cool. But, then your word is given.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who
      loves her, but not to one who does not. See him there, cold as marble and
      proud like his father. If he were rich, if he had Cavalcanti’s
      fortune, that might be pardoned. <i>Ma foi</i>, I haven’t consulted
      my daughter; but if she has good taste——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Monte Cristo, “my fondness may blind me, but
      I assure you I consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your
      daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of
      distinction, and his father’s position is good.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hem,” said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why do you doubt?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The past—that obscurity on the past.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But that does not affect the son.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very true.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, I beg of you, don’t go off your head. It’s a month
      now that you have been thinking of this marriage, and you must see that it
      throws some responsibility on me, for it was at my house you met this
      young Cavalcanti, whom I do not really know at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you made inquiry?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there any need of that! Does not his appearance speak for him?
      And he is very rich.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not so sure of that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet you said he had money.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fifty thousand livres—a mere trifle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is well educated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hem,” said Monte Cristo in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a musician.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So are all Italians.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, count, you do not do that young man justice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I acknowledge it annoys me, knowing your connection with the
      Morcerf family, to see him throw himself in the way.” Danglars burst
      out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a Puritan you are!” said he; “that happens every
      day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you cannot break it off in this way; the Morcerfs are depending
      on this union.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Positively.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then let them explain themselves; you should give the father a
      hint, you are so intimate with the family.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?—where the devil did you find out that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At their ball; it was apparent enough. Why, did not the countess,
      the proud Mercédès, the disdainful Catalane, who will scarcely open her
      lips to her oldest acquaintances, take your arm, lead you into the garden,
      into the private walks, and remain there for half an hour?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, baron, baron,” said Albert, “you are not listening—what
      barbarism in a megalomaniac like you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, don’t worry about me, Sir Mocker,” said Danglars;
      then turning to the count he said, “but will you undertake to speak
      to the father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Willingly, if you wish it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But let it be done explicitly and positively. If he demands my
      daughter let him fix the day—declare his conditions; in short, let
      us either understand each other, or quarrel. You understand—no more
      delay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir, I will give my attention to the subject.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision, but I do
      await it. A banker must, you know, be a slave to his promise.” And
      Danglars sighed as M. Cavalcanti had done half an hour before. “Bravi,
      bravo, brava!” cried Morcerf, parodying the banker, as the selection
      came to an end. Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf, when
      someone came and whispered a few words to him. “I shall soon return,”
      said the banker to Monte Cristo; “wait for me. I shall, perhaps,
      have something to say to you.” And he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baroness took advantage of her husband’s absence to push open
      the door of her daughter’s study, and M. Andrea, who was sitting
      before the piano with Mademoiselle Eugénie, started up like a
      jack-in-the-box. Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars, who
      did not appear in the least disturbed, and returned his bow with her usual
      coolness. Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to Morcerf, who
      replied with the most impertinent look possible. Then Albert launched out
      in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars’ voice, and on his regret, after
      what he had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous
      evening. Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said Madame Danglars, “leave music and
      compliments, and let us go and take tea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, Louise,” said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend. They
      passed into the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. Just as they
      were beginning, in the English fashion, to leave the spoons in their cups,
      the door again opened and Danglars entered, visibly agitated. Monte Cristo
      observed it particularly, and by a look asked the banker for an
      explanation. “I have just received my courier from Greece,”
      said Danglars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes,” said the count; “that was the reason of your
      running away from us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How is King Otho getting on?” asked Albert in the most
      sprightly tone. Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without
      answering, and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity
      which passed over his features, but which was gone in a moment. “We
      shall go together, shall we not?” said Albert to the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you like,” replied the latter. Albert could not understand
      the banker’s look, and turning to Monte Cristo, who understood it
      perfectly,—“Did you see,” said he, “how he looked
      at me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the count; “but did you think there was
      anything particular in his look?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can I tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I imagine you have correspondents in that country.”
      Monte Cristo smiled significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop,” said Albert, “here he comes. I shall compliment
      Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo, while the father talks to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you compliment her at all, let it be on her voice, at least,”
      said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, everyone would do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear viscount, you are dreadfully impertinent.” Albert
      advanced towards Eugénie, smiling. Meanwhile, Danglars, stooping to Monte
      Cristo’s ear, “Your advice was excellent,” said he;
      “there is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and
      Yanina.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?” said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I will tell you all; but take away the young man; I cannot
      endure his presence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is going with me. Shall I send the father to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Immediately.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well.” The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to
      the ladies, and took their leave, Albert perfectly indifferent to
      Mademoiselle Danglars’ contempt, Monte Cristo reiterating his advice
      to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker’s wife should exercise
      in providing for the future. M. Cavalcanti remained master of the field.

      Chapter 77. Haydée
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>carcely had the
      count’s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard, than Albert,
      turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of laughter—much
      too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and
      unnatural. “Well,” said he, “I will ask you the same
      question which Charles IX. put to Catherine de’ Medici, after the
      massacre of Saint Bartholomew, ‘How have I played my little part?’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To what do you allude?” asked Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the installation of my rival at M. Danglars’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What rival?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi!</i> what rival? Why, your protégé, M. Andrea Cavalcanti!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, no joking, viscount, if you please; I do not patronize M.
      Andrea—at least, not as concerns M. Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you would be to blame for not assisting him, if the young man
      really needed your help in that quarter, but, happily for me, he can
      dispense with it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, do you think he is paying his addresses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when
      addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions. He aspires
      to the hand of the proud Eugénie.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it is not the case, my dear count: on the contrary. I am
      repulsed on all sides.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is so indeed; Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely answers me, and
      Mademoiselle d’Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the father has the greatest regard possible for you,”
      said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He? Oh, no, he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart,
      tragedy-weapons, I own, which instead of wounding sheathe their points in
      their own handles, but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real
      and deadly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jealousy indicates affection.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True; but I am not jealous.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of whom?—of Debray?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of me? I will engage to say that before a week is past the door
      will be closed against me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are mistaken, my dear viscount.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Prove it to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you wish me to do so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the
      Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By whom are you charged?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the baron himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was
      capable. “You surely will not do that, my dear count?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly I shall, Albert, as I have promised to do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Albert, with a sigh, “it seems you are
      determined to marry me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody, at all
      events,” said Monte Cristo. “But apropos of Debray, how is it
      that I have not seen him lately at the baron’s house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There has been a misunderstanding.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, with the baroness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, with the baron.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has he perceived anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is a good joke!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think he suspects?” said Monte Cristo with charming
      artlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where have you come from, my dear count?” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “From Congo, if you will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It must be farther off than even that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what do I know of your Parisian husbands?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, my dear count, husbands are pretty much the same everywhere; an
      individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole
      race.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But then, what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and
      Debray? They seemed to understand each other so well,” said Monte
      Cristo with renewed energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis, in
      which I am not initiated. When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the
      family, you can ask him that question.” The carriage stopped.
      “Here we are,” said Monte Cristo; “it is only half-past
      ten o’clock, come in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My carriage shall take you back.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, thank you; I gave orders for my <i>coupé</i> to follow me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There it is, then,” said Monte Cristo, as he stepped out of
      the carriage. They both went into the house; the drawing-room was lighted
      up—they went in there. “You will make tea for us, Baptistin,”
      said the count. Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer, and in
      two seconds reappeared, bringing on a tray, all that his master had
      ordered, ready prepared, and appearing to have sprung from the ground,
      like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales. “Really, my dear
      count,” said Morcerf, “what I admire in you is, not so much
      your riches, for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself,
      nor is it only your wit, for Beaumarchais might have possessed as much,—but
      it is your manner of being served, without any questions, in a moment, in
      a second; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of
      ringing, and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in
      constant readiness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What you say is perhaps true; they know my habits. For instance,
      you shall see; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea-time?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, I should like to smoke.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it once. In about the space of a
      second a private door opened, and Ali appeared, bringing two chibouques
      filled with excellent latakia. “It is quite wonderful,” said
      Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh no, it is as simple as possible,” replied Monte Cristo.
      “Ali knows I generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee; he
      has heard that I ordered tea, and he also knows that I brought you home
      with me; when I summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing
      so, and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially
      manifested through the medium of smoking, he naturally concludes that we
      shall smoke in company, and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one—and
      now the mystery is solved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation, but
      it is not the less true that you——Ah, but what do I hear?”
      and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door, through which sounds
      seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, my dear viscount, you are fated to hear music this
      evening; you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars’ piano, to
      be attacked by Haydée’s guzla.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Haydée—what an adorable name! Are there, then, really women
      who bear the name of Haydée anywhere but in Byron’s poems?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly there are. Haydée is a very uncommon name in France, but
      is common enough in Albania and Epirus; it is as if you said, for example,
      Chastity, Modesty, Innocence,—it is a kind of baptismal name, as you
      Parisians call it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that is charming,” said Albert, “how I should like
      to hear my countrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness, Mademoiselle
      Silence, Mademoiselle Christian Charity! Only think, then, if Mademoiselle
      Danglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugénie, had been named
      Mademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars; what a fine effect that
      would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush,” said the count, “do not joke in so loud a tone;
      Haydée may hear you, perhaps.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you think she would be angry?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, certainly not,” said the count with a haughty expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is very amiable, then, is she not?” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not
      dictate to a master.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come; you are joking yourself now. Are there any more slaves to be
      had who bear this beautiful name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people.
      The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo! Why, it is a rank of itself in
      France, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that
      must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A hundred thousand francs! The poor girl originally possessed much
      more than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those
      recorded in the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i> would seem but poverty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She must be a princess then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought so. But how did it happen that such a great princess
      became a slave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster? The
      fortune of war, my dear viscount,—the caprice of fortune; that is
      the way in which these things are to be accounted for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And is her name a secret?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you, my
      dear viscount, who are one of my most intimate friends, and on whose
      silence I feel I may rely, if I consider it necessary to enjoin it—may
      I not do so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly; on my word of honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina, do you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of Ali Tepelini? [*] Oh, yes; it was in his service that my father
      made his fortune.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, I had forgotten that.”
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     * Ali Pasha, “The Lion,” was born at Tepelini, an Albanian
     village at the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741. By
     diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler
     of Albania, Epirus, and adjacent territory. Having aroused
     the enmity of the Sultan, he was proscribed and put to death
     by treachery in 1822, at the age of eighty.—Ed.

      “Well, what is Haydée to Ali Tepelini?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Merely his daughter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? the daughter of Ali Pasha?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And your slave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi</i>, yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how did she become so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day,
      as I was passing through the market at Constantinople.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wonderful! Really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic
      influence over all in which you are concerned; when I listen to you,
      existence no longer seems reality, but a waking dream. Now, I am perhaps
      going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request, but——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, since you go out with Haydée, and sometimes even take her to
      the opera——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think I may venture to ask you this favor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may venture to ask me anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then, my dear count, present me to your princess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do so; but on two conditions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I accept them at once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The first is, that you will never tell anyone that I have granted
      the interview.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well,” said Albert, extending his hand; “I swear I
      will not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever
      served hers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I give you my oath that I will not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Enough, viscount; you will remember those two vows, will you not?
      But I know you to be a man of honor.” The count again struck the
      gong. Ali reappeared. “Tell Haydée,” said he, “that I
      will take coffee with her, and give her to understand that I desire
      permission to present one of my friends to her.” Ali bowed and left
      the room. “Now, understand me,” said the count, “no
      direct questions, my dear Morcerf; if you wish to know anything, tell me,
      and I will ask her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Agreed.” Ali reappeared for the third time, and drew back the
      tapestried hanging which concealed the door, to signify to his master and
      Albert that they were at liberty to pass on. “Let us go in,”
      said Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his moustache, then,
      having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed the count
      into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves.
      Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard, and the door was kept by
      the three French attendants, commanded by Myrto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments,
      which was the drawing-room. Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and
      expectation, for it was the first time that any man, except Monte Cristo,
      had been accorded an entrance into her presence. She was sitting on a sofa
      placed in an angle of the room, with her legs crossed under her in the
      Eastern fashion, and seemed to have made for herself, as it were, a kind
      of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped her. Near her was the
      instrument on which she had just been playing; it was elegantly fashioned,
      and worthy of its mistress. On perceiving Monte Cristo, she arose and
      welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself, expressive at once of the
      most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love. Monte Cristo
      advanced towards her and extended his hand, which she as usual raised to
      her lips.

    <p>
      Albert had proceeded no farther than the door, where he remained rooted to
      the spot, being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing
      beauty, beheld as it was for the first time, and of which an inhabitant of
      more northern climes could form no adequate idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whom do you bring?” asked the young girl in Romaic, of Monte
      Cristo; “is it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an
      enemy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A friend,” said Monte Cristo in the same language.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is his name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count Albert; it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of
      the banditti at Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In what language would you like me to converse with him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo turned to Albert. “Do you know modern Greek,”
      asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas! no,” said Albert; “nor even ancient Greek, my
      dear count; never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Haydée, proving by her remark that she had quite
      understood Monte Cristo’s question and Albert’s answer,
      “then I will speak either in French or Italian, if my lord so wills
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Monte Cristo reflected one instant. “You will speak in Italian,”
      said he. Then, turning towards Albert,—“It is a pity you do
      not understand either ancient or modern Greek, both of which Haydée speaks
      so fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian,
      which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.”
      The count made a sign to Haydée to address his visitor. “Sir,”
      she said to Morcerf, “you are most welcome as the friend of my lord
      and master.” This was said in excellent Tuscan, and with that soft
      Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of
      Homer. Then, turning to Ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes,
      and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress
      she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her. Monte Cristo and Morcerf
      drew their seats towards a small table, on which were arranged music,
      drawings, and vases of flowers. Ali then entered bringing coffee and
      chibouques; as to M. Baptistin, this portion of the building was
      interdicted to him. Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered him.
      “Oh, take it—take it,” said the count; “Haydée is
      almost as civilized as a Parisian; the smell of a Havana is disagreeable
      to her, but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ali left the room. The cups of coffee were all prepared, with the addition
      of sugar, which had been brought for Albert. Monte Cristo and Haydée took
      the beverage in the original Arabian manner, that is to say, without
      sugar. Haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and
      conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when
      eating or drinking something which it likes. At this moment two women
      entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet, which they placed
      on two small tables appropriated to that purpose. “My dear host, and
      you, signora,” said Albert, in Italian, “excuse my apparent
      stupidity. I am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it should be so.
      Here I am in the heart of Paris; but a moment ago I heard the rumbling of
      the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade-sellers, and
      now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to the East; not such as I
      have seen it, but such as my dreams have painted it. Oh, signora, if I
      could but speak Greek, your conversation, added to the fairy-scene which
      surrounds me, would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be
      impossible for me ever to forget.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,”
      said Haydée quietly; “and if you like what is Eastern, I will do my
      best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On what subject shall I converse with her?” said Albert, in a
      low tone to Monte Cristo.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her
      youthful reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome,
      Naples, or Florence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Albert, “it is of no use to be in the company
      of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian; let
      me speak to her of the East.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be
      the most agreeable to her taste.” Albert turned towards Haydée.
      “At what age did you leave Greece, signora?” asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I left it when I was but five years old,” replied Haydée.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have you any recollection of your country?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again. The mind
      can see as well as the body. The body forgets sometimes—but the mind
      never forgets.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki,
      which means royal,” said the young girl, tossing her head proudly,
      “took me by the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money
      we possessed, we went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for
      the prisoners, saying, ‘He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the
      Lord.’ Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace, and
      without saying a word to my father, we sent it to the convent, where it
      was divided amongst the prisoners.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how old were you at that time?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was three years old,” said Haydée.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time
      when you were three years old?” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count,” said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, “do
      allow the signora to tell me something of her history. You prohibited my
      mentioning my father’s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to
      him of her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea
      how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful
      lips.” Monte Cristo turned to Haydée, and with an expression of
      countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his
      words, he said in Greek,—“Tell us the fate of your father; but
      neither the name of the traitor nor the treason.” Haydée sighed
      deeply, and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you saying to her?” said Morcerf in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not
      conceal anything from you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Albert, “this pious pilgrimage in behalf of
      the prisoners was your first remembrance; what is the next?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the
      shade of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters of
      which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror. Under the oldest
      and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my father; my
      mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by playing with
      his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the
      diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle. Then from time to
      time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no
      attention, but which he always answered in the same tone of voice, either
      ‘Kill,’ or ‘Pardon.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very strange,” said Albert, “to hear such words
      proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one
      needs constantly to be saying to one’s self, ‘This is no
      fiction, it is all reality,’ in order to believe it. And how does
      France appear in your eyes, accustomed as they have been to gaze on such
      enchanted scenes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think it is a fine country,” said Haydée, “but I see
      France as it really is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman;
      whereas my own country, which I can only judge of from the impression
      produced on my childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague
      atmosphere, which is luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances
      of it are sad or joyous.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So young,” said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count’s
      command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself, “is it
      possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Haydée turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same time
      some imperceptible sign, murmured,—“Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of
      our early childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just
      described to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest
      sadness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak, speak, signora,” said Albert, “I am listening
      with the most intense delight and interest to all you say.”

    <p>
      Haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile. “You wish me,
      then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?” said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg you to do so,” replied Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly
      awakened by my mother. We were in the palace of Yanina; she snatched me
      from the cushions on which I was sleeping, and on opening my eyes I saw
      hers filled with tears. She took me away without speaking. When I saw her
      weeping I began to cry too. ‘Hush, child!’ said she. At other
      times in spite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a child’s
      caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by
      crying as much as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an
      intonation of such extreme terror in my mother’s voice when she
      enjoined me to silence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was
      given. She bore me rapidly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I saw then that we were descending a large staircase; around us
      were all my mother’s servants carrying trunks, bags, ornaments,
      jewels, purses of gold, with which they were hurrying away in the greatest
      distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns
      and pistols, and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed
      since they have again become a nation. You may imagine there was something
      startling and ominous,” said Haydée, shaking her head and turning
      pale at the mere remembrance of the scene, “in this long file of
      slaves and women only half-aroused from sleep, or at least so they
      appeared to me, who was myself scarcely awake. Here and there on the walls
      of the staircase, were reflected gigantic shadows, which trembled in the
      flickering light of the pine-torches till they seemed to reach to the
      vaulted roof above.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Quick!’ said a voice at the end of the gallery. This
      voice made everyone bow before it, resembling in its effect the wind
      passing over a field of wheat, by its superior strength forcing every ear
      to yield obeisance. As for me, it made me tremble. This voice was that of
      my father. He came last, clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his
      hand the carbine which your emperor presented him. He was leaning on the
      shoulder of his favorite Selim, and he drove us all before him, as a
      shepherd would his straggling flock. My father,” said Haydée,
      raising her head, “was that illustrious man known in Europe under
      the name of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and before whom Turkey
      trembled.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced
      with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there
      was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which
      gleamed from the brilliant eyes of Haydée at this moment; she appeared
      like a Pythoness evoking a spectre, as she recalled to his mind the
      remembrance of the fearful death of this man, to the news of which all
      Europe had listened with horror. “Soon,” said Haydée, “we
      halted on our march, and found ourselves on the borders of a lake. My
      mother pressed me to her throbbing heart, and at the distance of a few
      paces I saw my father, who was glancing anxiously around. Four marble
      steps led down to the water’s edge, and below them was a boat
      floating on the tide.

      “From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large
      blank mass; it was the kiosk to which we were going. This kiosk appeared
      to me to be at a considerable distance, perhaps on account of the darkness
      of the night, which prevented any object from being more than partially
      discerned. We stepped into the boat. I remember well that the oars made no
      noise whatever in striking the water, and when I leaned over to ascertain
      the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palikares.
      [*] Besides the rowers, the boat contained only the women, my father,
      mother, Selim, and myself. The Palikares had remained on the shore of the
      lake, ready to cover our retreat; they were kneeling on the lowest of the
      marble steps, and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three
      others, in case of pursuit. Our bark flew before the wind. ‘Why does
      the boat go so fast?’ asked I of my mother.

      “‘Silence, child! Hush, we are flying!’ I did not
      understand. Why should my father fly?—he, the all-powerful—he,
      before whom others were accustomed to fly—he, who had taken for his
      device, ‘<i>They hate me; then they fear me!</i>’ It was,
      indeed, a flight which my father was trying to effect. I have been told
      since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina, fatigued with long
      service——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Haydée cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo, whose eyes had been
      riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative. The
      young girl then continued, speaking slowly, like a person who is either
      inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating.
      “You were saying, signora,” said Albert, who was paying the
      most implicit attention to the recital, “that the garrison of
      Yanina, fatigued with long service——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Had treated with the Seraskier [*] Koorshid, who had been sent by
      the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that
      Ali Tepelini—after having sent to the sultan a French officer in
      whom he reposed great confidence—resolved to retire to the asylum
      which he had long before prepared for himself, and which he called <i>kataphygion</i>,
      or the refuge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And this officer,” asked Albert, “do you remember his
      name, signora?” Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young
      girl, which was quite unperceived by Albert. “No,” said she,
      “I do not remember it just at this moment; but if it should occur to
      me presently, I will tell you.” Albert was on the point of
      pronouncing his father’s name, when Monte Cristo gently held up his
      finger in token of reproach; the young man recollected his promise, and
      was silent.

      “It was towards this kiosk that we were rowing. A ground floor,
      ornamented with arabesques, bathing its terraces in the water, and another
      floor, looking on the lake, was all which was visible to the eye. But
      beneath the ground floor, stretching out into the island, was a large
      subterranean cavern, to which my mother, myself, and the women were
      conducted. In this place were together 60,000. pouches and 200 barrels;
      the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold, and the barrels were
      filled with 30,000. pounds of gunpowder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Near the barrels stood Selim, my father’s favorite, whom I
      mentioned to you just now. He stood watch day and night with a lance
      provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand, and he had orders to blow
      up everything—kiosk, guards, women, gold, and Ali Tepelini himself—at
      the first signal given by my father. I remember well that the slaves,
      convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives, passed
      whole days and nights in praying, crying, and groaning. As for me, I can
      never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier, and
      whenever the angel of death summons me to another world, I am quite sure I
      shall recognize Selim. I cannot tell you how long we remained in this
      state; at that period I did not even know what time meant. Sometimes, but
      very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the
      palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as I never saw anything in
      the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selim’s
      fiery lance. My father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the
      remotest verge of the horizon, examining attentively every black speck
      which appeared on the lake, while my mother, reclining by his side, rested
      her head on his shoulder, and I played at his feet, admiring everything I
      saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm
      round objects insignificant in themselves, but which in its eyes are
      invested with the greatest importance. The heights of Pindus towered above
      us; the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of
      the lake, and the immense masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the
      distance, gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in reality
      gigantic fir-trees and myrtles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all
      the night, and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm, but paler than
      usual. ‘Take courage, Vasiliki,’ said he; ‘today arrives
      the firman of the master, and my fate will be decided. If my pardon be
      complete, we shall return triumphant to Yanina; if the news be
      inauspicious, we must fly this night.’—‘But supposing
      our enemy should not allow us to do so?’ said my mother. ‘Oh,
      make yourself easy on that head,’ said Ali, smiling; ‘Selim
      and his flaming lance will settle that matter. They would be glad to see
      me dead, but they would not like themselves to die with me.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did
      not come from my father’s heart. She prepared the iced water which
      he was in the habit of constantly drinking,—for since his sojourn at
      the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever,—after which
      she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque,
      which he sometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the wreaths
      of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the
      surrounding atmosphere. Presently he made such a sudden movement that I
      was paralyzed with fear. Then, without taking his eyes from the object
      which had first attracted his attention, he asked for his telescope. My
      mother gave it him, and as she did so, looked whiter than the marble
      against which she leaned. I saw my father’s hand tremble. ‘A
      boat!—two!—three!’ murmured my, father;—‘four!’
      He then arose, seizing his arms and priming his pistols. ‘Vasiliki,’
      said he to my mother, trembling perceptibly, ‘the instant approaches
      which will decide everything. In the space of half an hour we shall know
      the emperor’s answer. Go into the cavern with Haydée.’—‘I
      will not quit you,’ said Vasiliki; ‘if you die, my lord, I
      will die with you.’—‘Go to Selim!’ cried my
      father. ‘Adieu, my lord,’ murmured my mother, determining
      quietly to await the approach of death. ‘Take away Vasiliki!’
      said my father to his Palikares.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for me, I had been forgotten in the general confusion; I ran
      toward Ali Tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him, and he stooped
      down and pressed my forehead with his lips. Oh, how distinctly I remember
      that kiss!—it was the last he ever gave me, and I feel as if it were
      still warm on my forehead. On descending, we saw through the lattice-work
      several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view. At
      first they appeared like black specks, and now they looked like birds
      skimming the surface of the waves. During this time, in the kiosk at my
      father’s feet, were seated twenty Palikares, concealed from view by
      an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the
      boats. They were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother-of-pearl
      and silver, and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the
      floor. My father looked at his watch, and paced up and down with a
      countenance expressive of the greatest anguish. This was the scene which
      presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss.
      My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern. Selim
      was still at his post, and smiled sadly on us as we entered. We fetched
      our cushions from the other end of the cavern, and sat down by Selim. In
      great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other; and, young as I was, I
      quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert had often heard—not from his father, for he never spoke on
      the subject, but from strangers—the description of the last moments
      of the vizier of Yanina; he had read different accounts of his death, but
      the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of
      the young girl, and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression
      of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him. As to Haydée, these
      terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment, for
      she ceased speaking, her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower
      bowing beneath the violence of the storm; and her eyes gazing on vacancy
      indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the
      Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina, which, like a magic
      mirror, seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched. Monte
      Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and
      pity.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Haydée looked up abruptly, as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristo’s
      voice had awakened her from a dream; and she resumed her narrative.
      “It was about four o’clock in the afternoon, and although the
      day was brilliant out-of-doors, we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness
      of the cavern. One single, solitary light was burning there, and it
      appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness; it was Selim’s
      flaming lance. My mother was a Christian, and she prayed. Selim repeated
      from time to time the sacred words: ‘God is great!’ However,
      my mother had still some hope. As she was coming down, she thought she
      recognized the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople, and in
      whom my father placed so much confidence; for he knew that all the
      soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and generous. She
      advanced some steps towards the staircase, and listened. ‘They are
      approaching,’ said she; ‘perhaps they bring us peace and
      liberty!’—‘What do you fear, Vasiliki?’ said
      Selim, in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud. ‘If they do
      not bring us peace, we will give them war; if they do not bring life, we
      will give them death.’ And he renewed the flame of his lance with a
      gesture which made one think of Dionysus of old Crete. [*] But I, being
      only a little child, was terrified by this undaunted courage, which
      appeared to me both ferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with horror
      from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably
      awaited us.

    <p>
      “My mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble.
      ‘Mamma, mamma,’ said I, ‘are we really to be killed?’
      And at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers
      and lamentations. ‘My child,’ said Vasiliki, ‘may God
      preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much
      dread!’ Then, whispering to Selim, she asked what were her master’s
      orders. ‘If he send me his poniard, it will signify that the emperor’s
      intentions are not favorable, and I am to set fire to the powder; if, on
      the contrary, he send me his ring, it will be a sign that the emperor
      pardons him, and I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine
      untouched.’—‘My friend,’ said my mother, ‘when
      your master’s orders arrive, if it is the poniard which he sends,
      instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much
      dread, you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard, will you not?’—‘Yes,
      Vasiliki,’ replied Selim tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they
      were cries of joy. The name of the French officer who had been sent to
      Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was
      evident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was
      favorable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you not remember the Frenchman’s name?” said
      Morcerf, quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator. Monte Cristo made
      a sign to him to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not recollect it,” said Haydée.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and
      nearer; they were descending the steps leading to the cavern. Selim made
      ready his lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the
      entrance of the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight
      which had found their way into this gloomy retreat. ‘Who are you?’
      cried Selim. ‘But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance
      another step.’—‘Long live the emperor!’ said the
      figure. ‘He grants a full pardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only
      gives him his life, but restores to him his fortune and his possessions.’
      My mother uttered a cry of joy, and clasped me to her bosom. ‘Stop,’
      said Selim, seeing that she was about to go out; ‘you see I have not
      yet received the ring,’—‘True,’ said my mother.
      And she fell on her knees, at the same time holding me up towards heaven,
      as if she desired, while praying to God in my behalf, to raise me actually
      to his presence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the second time Haydée stopped, overcome by such violent emotion
      that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled voice
      seemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her throat
      and lips. Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and
      presented it to her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of
      command,—“Courage.”

    <p>
      Haydée dried her eyes, and continued: “By this time our eyes,
      habituated to the darkness, had recognized the messenger of the pasha,—it
      was a friend. Selim had also recognized him, but the brave young man only
      acknowledged one duty, which was to obey. ‘In whose name do you
      come?’ said he to him. ‘I come in the name of our master, Ali
      Tepelini.’—‘If you come from Ali himself,’ said
      Selim, ‘you know what you were charged to remit to me?’—‘Yes,’
      said the messenger, ‘and I bring you his ring.’ At these words
      he raised his hand above his head, to show the token; but it was too far
      off, and there was not light enough to enable Selim, where he was
      standing, to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view.
      ‘I do not see what you have in your hand,’ said Selim. ‘Approach
      then,’ said the messenger, ‘or I will come nearer to you, if
      you prefer it.’—‘I will agree to neither one nor the
      other,’ replied the young soldier; ‘place the object which I
      desire to see in the ray of light which shines there, and retire while I
      examine it.’—‘Be it so,’ said the envoy; and he
      retired, after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place
      pointed out to him by Selim.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, how our hearts palpitated; for it did, indeed, seem to be a
      ring which was placed there. But was it my father’s ring? that was
      the question. Selim, still holding in his hand the lighted match, walked
      towards the opening in the cavern, and, aided by the faint light which
      streamed in through the mouth of the cave, picked up the token.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘It is well,’ said he, kissing it; ‘it is my
      master’s ring!’ And throwing the match on the ground, he
      trampled on it and extinguished it. The messenger uttered a cry of joy and
      clapped his hands. At this signal four soldiers of the Seraskier Koorshid
      suddenly appeared, and Selim fell, pierced by five blows. Each man had
      stabbéd him separately, and, intoxicated by their crime, though still pale
      with fear, they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any
      fear of fire, after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of
      gold. At this moment my mother seized me in her arms, and hurrying
      noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves,
      she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk, where was a scene of
      frightful tumult and confusion. The lower rooms were entirely filled with
      Koorshid’s troops; that is to say, with our enemies. Just as my
      mother was on the point of pushing open a small door, we heard the voice
      of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone. My mother applied
      her eye to the crack between the boards; I luckily found a small opening
      which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within.
      ‘What do you want?’ said my father to some people who were
      holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold. ‘What we want,’
      replied one, ‘is to communicate to you the will of his highness. Do
      you see this firman?’—‘I do,’ said my father.
      ‘Well, read it; he demands your head.’

    <p>
      “My father answered with a loud laugh, which was more frightful than
      even threats would have been, and he had not ceased when two reports of a
      pistol were heard; he had fired them himself, and had killed two men. The
      Palikares, who were prostrated at my father’s feet, now sprang up
      and fired, and the room was filled with fire and smoke. At the same
      instant the firing began on the other side, and the balls penetrated the
      boards all round us. Oh, how noble did the grand vizier my father look at
      that moment, in the midst of the flying bullets, his scimitar in his hand,
      and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies! and how he
      terrified them, even then, and made them fly before him! ‘Selim,
      Selim!’ cried he, ‘guardian of the fire, do your duty!’—‘Selim
      is dead,’ replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of
      the earth, ‘and you are lost, Ali!’ At the same moment an
      explosion was heard, and the flooring of the room in which my father was
      sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms—the troops were
      firing from underneath. Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies
      literally ploughed with wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My father howled aloud, plunged his fingers into the holes which
      the balls had made, and tore up one of the planks entire. But immediately
      through this opening twenty more shots were fired, and the flame, rushing
      up like fire from the crater of a volcano, soon reached the tapestry,
      which it quickly devoured. In the midst of all this frightful tumult and
      these terrific cries, two reports, fearfully distinct, followed by two
      shrieks more heartrending than all, froze me with terror. These two shots
      had mortally wounded my father, and it was he who had given utterance to
      these frightful cries. However, he remained standing, clinging to a
      window. My mother tried to force the door, that she might go and die with
      him, but it was fastened on the inside. All around him were lying the
      Palikares, writhing in convulsive agonies, while two or three who were
      only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows.
      At this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way, my father fell on one
      knee, and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth, armed with
      sabres, pistols, and poniards—twenty blows were instantaneously
      directed against one man, and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire
      and smoke kindled by these demons, and which seemed like hell itself
      opening beneath his feet. I felt myself fall to the ground, my mother had
      fainted.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Haydée’s arms fell by her side, and she uttered a deep groan, at the
      same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with
      her obedience to his commands. Monte Cristo arose and approached her, took
      her hand, and said to her in Romaic, “Calm yourself, my dear child,
      and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish
      traitors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a frightful story, count,” said Albert, terrified at
      the paleness of Haydée’s countenance, “and I reproach myself
      now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, it is nothing,” said Monte Cristo. Then, patting the
      young girl on the head, he continued, “Haydée is very courageous,
      and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her
      misfortunes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because, my lord,” said Haydée eagerly, “my miseries
      recall to me the remembrance of your goodness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what he
      most desired to know,—how she had become the slave of the count.
      Haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of
      her two auditors; she exclaimed, ‘When my mother recovered her
      senses we were before the seraskier. ‘Kill,’ said she, ‘but
      spare the honor of the widow of Ali.’—‘It is not to me
      to whom you must address yourself,’ said Koorshid.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘To whom, then?’—‘To your new master.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Who and where is he?’—‘He is here.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “And Koorshid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to
      the death of my father,” said Haydée, in a tone of chastened anger.
      “Then,” said Albert, “you became the property of this
      man?”

    <p>
      “No,” replied Haydée, “he did not dare to keep us, so we
      were sold to some slave-merchants who were going to Constantinople. We
      traversed Greece, and arrived half dead at the imperial gates. They were
      surrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass, when
      suddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was
      attracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground,
      pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates, and
      beneath which were inscribed these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>This is the head of Ali Tepelini, Pasha of Yanina.</i>’
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cried bitterly, and tried to raise my mother from the earth, but
      she was dead! I was taken to the slave-market, and was purchased by a rich
      Armenian. He caused me to be instructed, gave me masters, and when I was
      thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmood.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of whom I bought her,” said Monte Cristo, “as I told
      you, Albert, with the emerald which formed a match to the one I had made
      into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you are good, you are great, my lord!” said Haydée,
      kissing the count’s hand, “and I am very fortunate in
      belonging to such a master!” Albert remained quite bewildered with
      all that he had seen and heard. “Come, finish your cup of coffee,”
      said Monte Cristo; “the history is ended.”

      Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f Valentine could
      have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he
      quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even she would have been constrained
      to pity him. Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent
      sentences, and then retired to his study, where he received about two
      hours afterwards the following letter:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier
      de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed
      between his family and that of M. Franz d’Epinay. M. d’Epinay
      must say that he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who
      appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning,
      should not have anticipated him in this announcement.”
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly unnerved
      by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would have
      supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance; although it
      certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor, or
      rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history. And in justice to
      Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier, who never cared for the
      opinion of his son on any subject, had always omitted to explain the
      affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life entertained the belief
      that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d’Epinay, as he was
      alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to identify him by his
      own family name, or by the title which had been conferred on him, fell the
      victim of assassination, and not that he was killed fairly in a duel. This
      harsh letter, coming as it did from a man generally so polite and
      respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride of Villefort. Hardly had he
      read the letter, when his wife entered. The sudden departure of Franz,
      after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so much astonished everyone, that
      the position of Madame de Villefort, left alone with the notary and the
      witnesses, became every moment more embarrassing. Determined to bear it no
      longer, she arose and left the room; saying she would go and make some
      inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Villefort’s communications on the subject were very limited
      and concise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place
      between M. Noirtier, M. d’Epinay, and himself, and that the marriage
      of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off. This was an
      awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting.
      She therefore contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier having at the
      commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit,
      the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer. This news,
      false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar
      misfortunes which had so recently occurred, evidently astonished the
      auditors, and they retired without a word. During this time Valentine, at
      once terrified and happy, after having embraced and thanked the feeble old
      man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been
      accustomed to consider as irrefragable, asked leave to retire to her own
      room, in order to recover her composure. Noirtier looked the permission
      which she solicited. But instead of going to her own room, Valentine,
      having once gained her liberty, entered the gallery, and, opening a small
      door at the end of it, found herself at once in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other,
      an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentine’s
      mind. She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear, pale
      and trembling, to forbid the signing of the contract, like the Laird of
      Ravenswood in <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>. It was high time for her to
      make her appearance at the gate, for Maximilian had long awaited her
      coming. He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the
      cemetery with M. de Villefort. He followed M. d’Epinay, saw him
      enter, afterwards go out, and then re-enter with Albert and
      Château-Renaud. He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the
      conference; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover-patch,
      prepared to hear the result of the proceedings, and very certain that
      Valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at
      liberty. He was not mistaken; peering through the crevices of the wooden
      partition, he soon discovered the young girl, who cast aside all her usual
      precautions and walked at once to the barrier. The first glance which
      Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him, and the first
      words she spoke made his heart bound with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are saved!” said Valentine. “Saved?” repeated
      Morrel, not being able to conceive such intense happiness; “by whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By my grandfather. Oh, Morrel, pray love him for all his goodness
      to us!” Morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that
      moment he could safely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not
      enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father. “But tell
      me, Valentine, how has it all been effected? What strange means has he
      used to compass this blessed end?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she
      suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret
      which concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said, “At
      some future time I will tell you all about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But when will that be?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I am your wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel, that
      he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose,
      and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard
      ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day. However, he
      would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next
      night. Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her, and certainly
      it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry
      Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not
      marry Franz.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame de
      Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier. The old man looked at her with
      that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to
      receive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said she, “it is superfluous for me to tell you
      that Valentine’s marriage is broken off, since it was here that the
      affair was concluded.” Noirtier’s countenance remained
      immovable. “But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think
      you are aware; that is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage,
      and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or
      approbation.” Noirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of
      a man desiring an explanation. “Now that this marriage, which I know
      you so much disliked, is done away with, I come to you on an errand which
      neither M. de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently undertake.”
      Noirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission. “I come to
      entreat you, sir,” continued Madame de Villefort, “as the only
      one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as I am the only one who will
      receive no personal benefit from the transaction,—I come to entreat
      you to restore, not your love, for that she has always possessed, but to
      restore your fortune to your granddaughter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a doubtful expression in Noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently
      trying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not succeed
      in doing so. “May I hope, sir,” said Madame de Villefort,
      “that your intentions accord with my request?” Noirtier made a
      sign that they did. “In that case, sir,” rejoined Madame de
      Villefort, “I will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and
      happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes.” She then bowed
      to M. Noirtier and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn up
      and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine,
      on condition that she should never be separated from him. It was then
      generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort, the heiress of the
      marquis and marchioness of Saint-Méran, had regained the good graces of
      her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in possession of an
      income of 300,000 livres.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the
      marriage-contract were being carried on at the house of M. de Villefort,
      Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf, who, in order to
      lose no time in responding to M. Danglars’ wishes, and at the same
      time to pay all due deference to his position in society, donned his
      uniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all his crosses,
      and thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to the Rue de la
      Chaussée d’Antin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the
      most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor. At the first
      sight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled
      himself in his easy-chair. Morcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted
      the banker in an affable and smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the
      overture he was about to make would be well received, he did not consider
      it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end, but went at
      once straight to the point.

    <p>
      “Well, baron,” said he, “here I am at last; some time
      has elapsed since our plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.”
      Morcerf paused at these words, quietly waiting till the cloud should have
      dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars, and which he
      attributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise, it
      grew darker and darker. “To what do you allude, monsieur?”
      said Danglars; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible
      meaning of the general’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Morcerf, “I see you are a stickler for forms,
      my dear sir, and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not
      be omitted. <i>Ma foi</i>, I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son,
      and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still
      serving my apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.” And
      Morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M. Danglars,
      said: “Baron, I have the honor of asking of you the hand of
      Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner
      which Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the count,
      who was still standing, to take a seat, he said: “Monsieur, it will
      be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To reflect?” said Morcerf, more and more astonished; “have
      you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have
      elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Count,” said the banker, “things are constantly
      occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established
      opinions, or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the
      change of circumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally
      different light to that in which we at first viewed them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand you, baron,” said Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What I mean to say is this, sir,—that during the last
      fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse me,” said Morcerf, “but is it a play we are
      acting?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A play?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and
      endeavor thoroughly to understand each other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is quite my desire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have seen M. de Monte Cristo have you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see him very often,” said Danglars, drawing himself up;
      “he is a particular friend of mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that I
      appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did you
      not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did say so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, here I am, proving at once that I am really neither the one
      nor the other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Danglars did not answer. “Have you so soon changed your mind,”
      added Morcerf, “or have you only provoked my request that you may
      have the pleasure of seeing me humbled?” Danglars, seeing that if he
      continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it, the
      whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage, turned to Morcerf, and
      said: “Count, you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve, and I
      assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you; but,
      believe me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful
      task upon me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “These are all so many empty words, my dear sir,” said
      Morcerf: “they might satisfy a new acquaintance, but the Comte de
      Morcerf does not rank in that list; and when a man like him comes to
      another, recalls to him his plighted word, and this man fails to redeem
      the pledge, he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so
      doing.” Danglars was a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was
      piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed. “I am not without
      a good reason for my conduct,” replied the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean to say?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean to say that I have a good reason, but that it is difficult
      to explain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must be aware, at all events, that it is impossible for me to
      understand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at least
      is clear, which is, that you decline allying yourself with my family.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir,” said Danglars; “I merely suspend my decision,
      that is all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your
      caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received
      into your good graces?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, count, if you will not wait, we must look upon these projects
      as if they had never been entertained.” The count bit his lips till
      the blood almost started, to prevent the ebullition of anger which his
      proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain;
      understanding, however, that in the present state of things the laugh
      would decidedly be against him, he turned from the door, towards which he
      had been directing his steps, and again confronted the banker. A cloud
      settled on his brow, evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness, instead of
      the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there. “My
      dear Danglars,” said Morcerf, “we have been acquainted for
      many years, and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each
      other’s failings. You owe me an explanation, and really it is but
      fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son
      of your favor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is from no personal ill-feeling towards the viscount, that is
      all I can say, sir,” replied Danglars, who resumed his insolent
      manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and
      calmed down. “And towards whom do you bear this personal
      ill-feeling, then?” said Morcerf, turning pale with anger. The
      expression of the count’s face had not remained unperceived by the
      banker; he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before, and said:
      “You may, perhaps, be better satisfied that I should not go farther
      into particulars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count, and making
      a violent effort over himself, he said: “I have a right to insist on
      your giving me an explanation. Is it Madame de Morcerf who has displeased
      you? Is it my fortune which you find insufficient? Is it because my
      opinions differ from yours?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing of the kind, sir,” replied Danglars: “if such
      had been the case, I only should have been to blame, inasmuch as I was
      aware of all these things when I made the engagement. No, do not seek any
      longer to discover the reason. I really am quite ashamed to have been the
      cause of your undergoing such severe self-examination; let us drop the
      subject, and adopt the middle course of delay, which implies neither a
      rupture nor an engagement. <i>Ma foi</i>, there is no hurry. My daughter
      is only seventeen years old, and your son twenty-one. While we wait, time
      will be progressing, events will succeed each other; things which in the
      evening look dark and obscure, appear but too clearly in the light of
      morning, and sometimes the utterance of one word, or the lapse of a single
      day, will reveal the most cruel calumnies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Calumnies, did you say, sir?” cried Morcerf, turning livid
      with rage. “Does anyone dare to slander me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur, I told you that I considered it best to avoid all
      explanation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, sir, I am patiently to submit to your refusal?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir, although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to
      give as it is for you to receive, for I had reckoned on the honor of your
      alliance, and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the
      lady more than the gentleman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Enough, sir,” said Morcerf, “we will speak no more on
      the subject.” And clutching his gloves in anger, he left the
      apartment. Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf
      had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars
      recalled his word. That evening he had a long conference with several
      friends; and M. Cavalcanti, who had remained in the drawing-room with the
      ladies, was the last to leave the banker’s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, as soon as he awoke, Danglars asked for the newspapers;
      they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and at last fixed
      on <i>l’Impartial</i>, the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief
      editor. He hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with nervous
      precipitation, passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings, and arriving
      at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious smile, at a
      paragraph headed
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>We hear from Yanina.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good,” observed Danglars, after having read the
      paragraph; “here is a little article on Colonel Fernand, which, if I
      am not mistaken, would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf
      required of me perfectly unnecessary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, that is, at nine o’clock in the morning, Albert
      de Morcerf, dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin, might have
      been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte
      Cristo’s house in the Champs-Élysées. When he presented himself at
      the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an
      hour previously. “Did he take Baptistin with him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my lord.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Call him, then; I wish to speak to him.” The concierge went
      to seek the valet de chambre, and returned with him in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My good friend,” said Albert, “I beg pardon for my
      intrusion, but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master
      was really out or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is really out, sir,” replied Baptistin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Out, even to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte,”
      said Baptistin; “and I should therefore never think of including him
      in any general order.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right; and now I wish to see him on an affair of great
      importance. Do you think it will be long before he comes in?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I think not, for he ordered his breakfast at ten o’clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I will go and take a turn in the Champs-Élysées, and at ten o’clock
      I will return here; meanwhile, if the count should come in, will you beg
      him not to go out again without seeing me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may depend on my doing so, sir,” said Baptistin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert left the cab in which he had come at the count’s door,
      intending to take a turn on foot. As he was passing the Allée des Veuves,
      he thought he saw the count’s horses standing at Gosset’s
      shooting-gallery; he approached, and soon recognized the coachman. “Is
      the count shooting in the gallery?” said Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” replied the coachman. While he was speaking,
      Albert had heard the report of two or three pistol-shots. He entered, and
      on his way met the waiter. “Excuse me, my lord,” said the lad;
      “but will you have the kindness to wait a moment?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What for, Philip?” asked Albert, who, being a constant
      visitor there, did not understand this opposition to his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone,
      and never practices in the presence of anyone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not even before you, Philip? Then who loads his pistol?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His servant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Nubian?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A negro.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is he, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know this gentleman?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and I am come to look for him; he is a friend of mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, that is quite another thing, then. I will go immediately and
      inform him of your arrival.” And Philip, urged by his own curiosity,
      entered the gallery; a second afterwards, Monte Cristo appeared on the
      threshold. “I ask your pardon, my dear count,” said Albert,
      “for following you here, and I must first tell you that it was not
      the fault of your servants that I did so; I alone am to blame for the
      indiscretion. I went to your house, and they told me you were out, but
      that they expected you home at ten o’clock to breakfast. I was
      walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o’clock, when
      I caught sight of your carriage and horses.”

    <p>
      “What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend
      breakfasting with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, thank you, I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just
      now; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What on earth are you talking of?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am to fight today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For what?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For the sake of fighting!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I understand that, but what is the quarrel? People fight for
      all sorts of reasons, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I fight in the cause of honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that is something serious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So serious, that I come to beg you to render me a service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be my second.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is a serious matter, and we will not discuss it here; let us
      speak of nothing till we get home. Ali, bring me some water.” The
      count turned up his sleeves, and passed into the little vestibule where
      the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting. “Come
      in, my lord,” said Philip in a low tone, “and I will show you
      something droll.” Morcerf entered, and in place of the usual target,
      he saw some playing-cards fixed against the wall. At a distance Albert
      thought it was a complete suit, for he counted from the ace to the ten.
      “Ah, ha,” said Albert, “I see you were preparing for a
      game of cards.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said the count, “I was making a suit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How?” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those are really aces and twos which you see, but my shots have
      turned them into threes, fives, sevens, eights, nines, and tens.”
      Albert approached. In fact, the bullets had actually pierced the cards in
      the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied,
      the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled
      with pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Diable!</i>” said Morcerf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What would you have, my dear viscount?” said Monte Cristo,
      wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him; “I must
      occupy my leisure moments in some way or other. But come, I am waiting for
      you.” Both men entered Monte Cristo’s carriage, which in the
      course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No. 30. Monte Cristo took
      Albert into his study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself.
      “Now let us talk the matter over quietly,” said the count.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      “You see I am perfectly composed,” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With whom are you going to fight?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With Beauchamp.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One of your friends!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course; it is always with friends that one fights.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What has he done to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There appeared in his journal last night—but wait, and read
      for yourself.” And Albert handed over the paper to the count, who
      read as follows:—
    </p>
    <p>
      “A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now
      we had remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of
      the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand, in
      whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Monte Cristo, “what do you see in that to
      annoy you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do I see in it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given
      up by a French officer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian
      name is Fernand!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did your father serve under Ali Pasha?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; that is to say, he fought for the independence of the Greeks,
      and hence arises the calumny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not desire to do otherwise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the
      officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person? and
      who cares now about Yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822
      or 1823?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That just shows the meanness of this slander. They have allowed all
      this time to elapse, and then all of a sudden rake up events which have
      been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal, in order to tarnish the
      lustre of our high position. I inherit my father’s name, and I do
      not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it. I am going to
      Beauchamp, in whose journal this paragraph appears, and I shall insist on
      his retracting the assertion before two witnesses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Beauchamp will never retract.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then he must fight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No he will not, for he will tell you, what is very true, that
      perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will fight, nevertheless. I will efface that blot on my father’s
      character. My father, who was such a brave soldier, whose career was so
      brilliant——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, well, he will add, ‘We are warranted in believing that
      this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf, who also bears the
      same Christian name.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire
      retractation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses,
      do you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked
      of you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know my theory regarding duels; I told you my opinion on that
      subject, if you remember, when we were at Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless, my dear count, I found you this morning engaged in an
      occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to
      entertain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because, my dear fellow, you understand one must never be
      eccentric. If one’s lot is cast among fools, it is necessary to
      study folly. I shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some
      harebrained scamp, who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you
      have with Beauchamp; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or
      other, he will bring his witnesses, or will insult me in some public
      place, and I am expected to kill him for all that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You admit that you would fight, then? Well, if so, why do you
      object to my doing so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not say that you ought not to fight, I only say that a duel is
      a serious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did he reflect before he insulted my father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he spoke hastily, and owns that he did so, you ought to be
      satisfied.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my dear count, you are far too indulgent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you are far too exacting. Supposing, for instance, and do not
      be angry at what I am going to say——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Supposing the assertion to be really true?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father’s
      honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Ma foi!</i> we live in times when there is much to which we must
      submit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is precisely the fault of the age.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you undertake to reform it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, as far as I am personally concerned.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you are indeed exacting, my dear fellow!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I own it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you quite impervious to good advice?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not when it comes from a friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you account me that title?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses, seek
      further information on the subject.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From whom?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “From Haydée.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair?—what
      can she do in it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “She can declare to you, for example, that your father had no hand
      whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier; or if by chance he had,
      indeed, the misfortune to——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have told you, my dear count, that I would not for one moment
      admit of such a proposition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You reject this means of information, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do—most decidedly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then let me offer one more word of advice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do so, then, but let it be the last.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary, I request it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchamp—visit
      him alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That would be contrary to all custom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your case is not an ordinary one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is your reason for advising me to go alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Explain yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do so. If Beauchamp be disposed to retract, you ought at
      least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will,—the
      satisfaction to you will be the same. If, on the contrary, he refuses to
      do so, it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your
      secret.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They will not be strangers, they will be friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow;
      Beauchamp, for instance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So you recommend——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I recommend you to be prudent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do, and I will tell you why. When you wish to obtain some
      concession from a man’s self-love, you must avoid even the
      appearance of wishing to wound it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe you are right.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am glad of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I will go alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go; but you would do better still by not going at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do so, then; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you
      proposed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to
      fight, will you not be my second?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear viscount,” said Monte Cristo gravely, “you must
      have seen before today that at all times and in all places I have been at
      your disposal, but the service which you have just demanded of me is one
      which it is out of my power to render you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps you may know at some future period, and in the mean time I
      request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I will have Franz and Château-Renaud; they will be the very
      men for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do so, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson
      or two in shooting and fencing?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That, too, is impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a singular being you are!—you will not interfere in
      anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right—that is the principle on which I wish to act.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will say no more about it, then. Good-bye, count.” Morcerf
      took his hat, and left the room. He found his carriage at the door, and
      doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp,
      who was in his office. It was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as
      journalists’ offices have always been from time immemorial. The
      servant announced M. Albert de Morcerf. Beauchamp repeated the name to
      himself, as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and
      then gave orders for him to be admitted. Albert entered. Beauchamp uttered
      an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample
      under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room. “This
      way, this way, my dear Albert!” said he, holding out his hand to the
      young man. “Are you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to
      take breakfast with me? Try and find a seat—there is one by that
      geranium, which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are
      other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Beauchamp,” said Albert, “it is of your journal that I
      come to speak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed? What do you wish to say about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To what do you refer? But pray sit down.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you,” said Albert, with a cold and formal bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the
      statement which has displeased you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a
      member of my family.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?” said Beauchamp, much surprised; “surely
      you must be mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The story sent you from Yanina.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yanina?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which
      brings me here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Such is really the case, I assure you, upon my honor! Baptiste,
      give me yesterday’s paper,” cried Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, I have brought mine with me,” replied Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which Albert pointed in
      an undertone. “You see it is a serious annoyance,” said
      Morcerf, when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph. “Is
      the officer referred to a relation of yours, then?” demanded the
      journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Albert, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what do you wish me to do for you?” said Beauchamp
      mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Beauchamp, I wish you to contradict this statement.”
      Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said he, “this matter will want a good deal of
      talking over; a retractation is always a serious thing, you know. Sit
      down, and I will read it again.” Albert resumed his seat, and
      Beauchamp read, with more attention than at first, the lines denounced by
      his friend. “Well,” said Albert in a determined tone, “you
      see that your paper has insulted a member of my family, and I insist on a
      retractation being made.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You insist?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I insist.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber, my dear
      Viscount.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nor do I wish to be there,” replied the young man, rising.
      “I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday
      contradicted. You have known me long enough,” continued Albert,
      biting his lips convulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp’s anger was
      beginning to rise,—“you have been my friend, and therefore
      sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my
      resolution on this point.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I have been your friend, Morcerf, your present manner of
      speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title. But
      wait a moment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet. You are
      irritated and vexed—tell me how this Fernand is related to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is merely my father,” said Albert—“M. Fernand
      Mondego, Count of Morcerf, an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles
      and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it your father?” said Beauchamp; “that is quite
      another thing. Then I can well understand your indignation, my dear
      Albert. I will look at it again;” and he read the paragraph for the
      third time, laying a stress on each word as he proceeded. “But the
      paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore I will
      have the article contradicted.” At the words <i>I will</i>,
      Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Albert’s countenance, and then
      as gradually lowering them, he remained thoughtful for a few moments.
      “You will retract this assertion, will you not, Beauchamp?”
      said Albert with increased though stifled anger.

    </h5>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Immediately?” said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I am convinced that the statement is false.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The thing is worth looking into, and I will take pains to
      investigate the matter thoroughly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what is there to investigate, sir?” said Albert, enraged
      beyond measure at Beauchamp’s last remark. “If you do not
      believe that it is my father, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary,
      you believe it to be him, state your reasons for doing so.”
      Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him,
      and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied
      emotion of his mind. “Sir,” replied he, “if you came to
      me with the idea of demanding satisfaction, you should have gone at once
      to the point, and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to
      which I have been patiently listening for the last half hour. Am I to put
      this construction on your visit?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait a moment—no threats, if you please, M. Fernand Mondego,
      Vicomte de Morcerf; I never allow them from my enemies, and therefore
      shall not put up with them from my friends. You insist on my contradicting
      the article relating to General Fernand, an article with which, I assure
      you on my word of honor, I had nothing whatever to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I insist on it,” said Albert, whose mind was beginning
      to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?” said
      Beauchamp in a calm tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Albert, raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Beauchamp, “here is my answer, my dear sir.
      The article was not inserted by me—I was not even aware of it; but
      you have, by the step you have taken, called my attention to the paragraph
      in question, and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or
      confirmed by someone who has a right to do so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said Albert, rising, “I will do myself the honor
      of sending my seconds to you, and you will be kind enough to arrange with
      them the place of meeting and the weapons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, my dear sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And this evening, if you please, or tomorrow at the latest, we will
      meet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, I will be on the ground at the proper time; but in my
      opinion (and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries, as it is I who
      have received the provocation)—in my opinion the time ought not to
      be yet. I know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword,
      while I am only moderately so; I know, too, that you are a good marksman—there
      we are about equal. I know that a duel between us two would be a serious
      affair, because you are brave, and I am brave also. I do not therefore
      wish either to kill you, or to be killed myself without a cause. Now, I am
      going to put a question to you, and one very much to the purpose too. Do
      you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it,
      although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on my honor, that I
      was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me, and although I still
      declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of
      Morcerf under the name of Fernand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I maintain my original resolution.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, my dear sir; then I consent to cut throats with you. But
      I require three weeks’ preparation; at the end of that time I shall
      come and say to you, ‘The assertion is false, and I retract it,’
      or ‘The assertion is true,’ when I shall immediately draw the
      sword from its sheath, or the pistols from the case, whichever you please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Three weeks!” cried Albert; “they will pass as slowly
      as three centuries when I am all the time suffering dishonor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me, I should
      have said, ‘Patience, my friend;’ but you have constituted
      yourself my enemy, therefore I say, ‘What does that signify to me,
      sir?’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, let it be three weeks then,” said Morcerf; “but
      remember, at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will
      justify you in——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Albert de Morcerf,” said Beauchamp, rising in his turn,
      “I cannot throw you out of window for three weeks—that is to
      say, for twenty-four days to come—nor have you any right to split my
      skull open till that time has elapsed. Today is the 29th of August; the
      21st of September will, therefore, be the conclusion of the term agreed
      on, and till that time arrives—and it is the advice of a gentleman
      which I am about to give you—till then we will refrain from growling
      and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other.” When
      he had concluded his speech, Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert, turned his
      back upon him, and went to the press-room.

    <p>
      Albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers, which he sent flying all
      over the office by switching them violently with his stick; after which
      ebullition he departed—not, however, without walking several times
      to the door of the press-room, as if he had half a mind to enter. While
      Albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he
      had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture, as
      he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel, who was walking with a
      quick step and a bright eye. He was passing the Chinese Baths, and
      appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte Saint-Martin, and to
      be going towards the Madeleine. “Ah,” said Morcerf, “there
      goes a happy man!” And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his
      opinion.

      Chapter 79. The Lemonade
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>orrel was, in
      fact, very happy. M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and he was in such
      haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a
      cab, placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the
      four legs of a cab-horse. He had therefore set off at a furious rate from
      the Rue Meslay, and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of
      the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel advanced with a firm, manly tread, and poor Barrois followed him as
      he best might. Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age;
      Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion.
      These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a
      triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet nevertheless
      possessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and it
      was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request that the latter
      would lose no time in coming to him—a command which Morrel obeyed to
      the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois. On arriving at the
      house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings to our
      desires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to love, was
      sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the door
      of the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of
      Valentine. She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress,
      and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he
      felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her
      grandfather. But the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling along the
      floor, and he soon made his appearance in the room. Noirtier acknowledged
      by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel
      lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and
      himself—an intervention which had saved them from despair. Morrel
      then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which
      he designed to bestow on him. Valentine was sitting at a little distance
      from them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to
      speak. Noirtier fixed his eyes on her. “Am I to say what you told
      me?” asked Valentine. Noirtier made a sign that she was to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur Morrel,” said Valentine to the young man, who was
      regarding her with the most intense interest, “my grandfather, M.
      Noirtier, had a thousand things to say, which he told me three days ago;
      and now, he has sent for you, that I may repeat them to you. I will repeat
      them, then; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter, I will be
      faithful to the trust, and will not alter a word of his intentions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I am listening with the greatest impatience,” replied the
      young man; “speak, I beg of you.” Valentine cast down her
      eyes; this was a good omen for Morrel, for he knew that nothing but
      happiness could have the power of thus overcoming Valentine. “My
      grandfather intends leaving this house,” said she, “and
      Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you, Mademoiselle de Villefort,—you, who are necessary to
      M. Noirtier’s happiness——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I?” interrupted Valentine; “I shall not leave my
      grandfather,—that is an understood thing between us. My apartment
      will be close to his. Now, M. de Villefort must either give his consent to
      this plan or his refusal; in the first case, I shall leave directly, and
      in the second, I shall wait till I am of age, which will be in about ten
      months. Then I shall be free, I shall have an independent fortune, and”—
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what?” demanded Morrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And with my grandfather’s consent I shall fulfil the promise
      which I have made you.” Valentine pronounced these last few words in
      such a low tone, that nothing but Morrel’s intense interest in what
      she was saying could have enabled him to hear them. “Have I not
      explained your wishes, grandpapa?” said Valentine, addressing
      Noirtier. “Yes,” looked the old man.—“Once under
      my grandfather’s roof, M. Morrel can visit me in the presence of my
      good and worthy protector, if we still feel that the union we contemplated
      will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness; in that case I
      shall expect M. Morrel to come and claim me at my own hands. But, alas, I
      have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew
      cold in time of security; I trust we shall never find it so in our
      experience!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” cried Morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his
      knees before Noirtier and Valentine, and to adore them as two superior
      beings, “what have I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded
      happiness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Until that time,” continued the young girl in a calm and
      self-possessed tone of voice, “we will conform to circumstances, and
      be guided by the wishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not
      tend finally to separate us; in a word, and I repeat it, because it
      expresses all I wish to convey,—we will wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes,
      sir,” said Morrel, “not only with resignation, but with
      cheerfulness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Therefore,” continued Valentine, looking playfully at
      Maximilian, “no more inconsiderate actions—no more rash
      projects; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this
      day regards herself as destined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel looked obedience to her commands. Noirtier regarded the lovers with
      a look of ineffable tenderness, while Barrois, who had remained in the
      room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed,
      smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald
      forehead. “How hot you look, my good Barrois,” said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but I must do M.
      Morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.” Noirtier
      directed their attention to a waiter, on which was placed a decanter
      containing lemonade and a glass. The decanter was nearly full, with the
      exception of a little, which had been already drunk by M. Noirtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, Barrois,” said the young girl, “take some of this
      lemonade; I see you are coveting a good draught of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact is, mademoiselle,” said Barrois, “I am dying
      with thirst, and since you are so kind as to offer it me, I cannot say I
      should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take some, then, and come back immediately.” Barrois took
      away the waiter, and hardly was he outside the door, which in his haste he
      forgot to shut, than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the
      very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled. Valentine and Morrel were
      exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard
      at the door-bell. It was the signal of a visit. Valentine looked at her
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is past noon,” said she, “and today is Saturday; I
      dare say it is the doctor, grandpapa.” Noirtier looked his
      conviction that she was right in her supposition. “He will come in
      here, and M. Morrel had better go,—do you not think so, grandpapa?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” signed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Barrois,” cried Valentine, “Barrois!”

    </h5>
    <p>
      “I am coming, mademoiselle,” replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Barrois will open the door for you,” said Valentine,
      addressing Morrel. “And now remember one thing, Monsieur Officer,
      that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill-advised step
      which would be likely to compromise our happiness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I promised him to wait,” replied Morrel; “and I will
      wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Barrois entered. “Who rang?” asked Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doctor d’Avrigny,” said Barrois, staggering as if he
      would fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the matter, Barrois?” said Valentine. The old man did
      not answer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with
      his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand
      upright. “He is going to fall!” cried Morrel. The rigors which
      had attacked Barrois gradually increased, the features of the face became
      quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to
      indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder. Noirtier, seeing
      Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the various
      emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man.
      Barrois made some steps towards his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, sir,” said he, “tell me what is the matter with me.
      I am suffering—I cannot see. A thousand fiery darts are piercing my
      brain. Ah, don’t touch me, pray don’t.” By this time his
      haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their
      sockets; his head fell back, and the lower extremities of the body began
      to stiffen. Valentine uttered a cry of horror; Morrel took her in his
      arms, as if to defend her from some unknown danger. “M. d’Avrigny,
      M. d’Avrigny,” cried she, in a stifled voice. “Help,
      help!” Barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few
      steps, then fell at the feet of Noirtier, and resting his hand on the knee
      of the invalid, exclaimed, “My master, my good master!” At
      this moment M. de Villefort, attracted by the noise, appeared on the
      threshold. Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine, and retreating to a
      distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain. Pale as
      if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his terrified eye on the
      agonized sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noirtier, burning with impatience and terror, was in despair at his utter
      inability to help his old domestic, whom he regarded more in the light of
      a friend than a servant. One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of
      his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye, trace the
      terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and
      the inanimate and helpless body. Barrois, his features convulsed, his eyes
      suffused with blood, and his head thrown back, was lying at full length,
      beating the floor with his hands, while his legs had become so stiff, that
      they looked as if they would break rather than bend. A slight appearance
      of foam was visible around the mouth, and he breathed painfully, and with
      extreme difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment, and remained gazing intently
      on the scene before him without uttering a word. He had not seen Morrel.
      After a moment of dumb contemplation, during which his face became pale
      and his hair seemed to stand on end, he sprang towards the door, crying
      out, “Doctor, doctor! come instantly, pray come!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame, madame!” cried Valentine, calling her step-mother,
      and running upstairs to meet her; “come quick, quick!—and
      bring your bottle of smelling-salts with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the matter?” said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and
      constrained tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, come, come!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But where is the doctor?” exclaimed Villefort; “where
      is he?” Madame de Villefort now deliberately descended the
      staircase. In one hand she held her handkerchief, with which she appeared
      to be wiping her face, and in the other a bottle of English
      smelling-salts. Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier, whose
      face, independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of
      producing, proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health; her
      second glance was at the dying man. She turned pale, and her eye passed
      quickly from the servant and rested on the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the name of heaven, madame,” said Villefort, “where
      is the doctor? He was with you just now. You see this is a fit of
      apoplexy, and he might be saved if he could but be bled!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has he eaten anything lately?” asked Madame de Villefort,
      eluding her husband’s question. “Madame,” replied
      Valentine, “he has not even breakfasted. He has been running very
      fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him, and when he
      returned, took nothing but a glass of lemonade.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” said Madame de Villefort, “why did he not take
      wine? Lemonade was a very bad thing for him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Grandpapa’s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side;
      poor Barrois was very thirsty, and was thankful to drink anything he could
      find.” Madame de Villefort started. Noirtier looked at her with a
      glance of the most profound scrutiny. “He has such a short neck,”
      said she. “Madame,” said Villefort, “I ask where is M. d’Avrigny?
      In God’s name answer me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is with Edward, who is not quite well,” replied Madame de
      Villefort, no longer being able to avoid answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him. “Take this,” said
      Madame de Villefort, giving her smelling-bottle to Valentine. “They
      will, no doubt, bleed him; therefore I will retire, for I cannot endure
      the sight of blood;” and she followed her husband upstairs. Morrel
      now emerged from his hiding-place, where he had remained quite
      unperceived, so great had been the general confusion. “Go away as
      quick as you can, Maximilian,” said Valentine, “and stay till
      I send for you. Go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire. The old man, who
      had preserved all his usual coolness, made a sign to him to do so. The
      young man pressed Valentine’s hand to his lips, and then left the
      house by a back staircase. At the same moment that he quitted the room,
      Villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door. Barrois was now
      showing signs of returning consciousness. The crisis seemed past, a low
      moaning was heard, and he raised himself on one knee. D’Avrigny and
      Villefort laid him on a couch. “What do you prescribe, doctor?”
      demanded Villefort. “Give me some water and ether. You have some in
      the house, have you not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort immediately despatched a messenger. “And now let everyone
      retire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Must I go too?” asked Valentine timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, mademoiselle, you especially,” replied the doctor
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentine looked at M. d’Avrigny with astonishment, kissed her
      grandfather on the forehead, and left the room. The doctor closed the door
      after her with a gloomy air. “Look, look, doctor,” said
      Villefort, “he is quite coming round again; I really do not think,
      after all, it is anything of consequence.” M. d’Avrigny
      answered by a melancholy smile. “How do you feel, Barrois?”
      asked he. “A little better, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you drink some of this ether and water?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will try; but don’t touch me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of
      your finger the fit would return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Drink.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrois took the glass, and, raising it to his purple lips, took about
      half of the liquid offered him. “Where do you suffer?” asked
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everywhere. I feel cramps over my whole body.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any noise in the ears?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Frightful.”

    <p>
      “When did you first feel that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suddenly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, like a clap of thunder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No drowsiness?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “None.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What have you eaten today?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master’s
      lemonade—that’s all;” and Barrois turned towards
      Noirtier, who, immovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this
      terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is this lemonade?” asked the doctor eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Downstairs in the decanter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whereabouts downstairs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the kitchen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I go and fetch it, doctor?” inquired Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass
      of ether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.” D’Avrigny
      bounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and almost knocked
      down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself going down to the
      kitchen. She cried out, but d’Avrigny paid no attention to her;
      possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four steps with a bound,
      and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the decanter about three parts
      empty still standing on the waiter, where it had been left. He darted upon
      it as an eagle would seize upon its prey. Panting with loss of breath, he
      returned to the room he had just left. Madame de Villefort was slowly
      ascending the steps which led to her room. “Is this the decanter you
      spoke of?” asked d’Avrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, doctor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did it taste like?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It had a bitter taste.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand,
      put his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when
      he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is no doubt the same,” said he. “Did you drink some
      too, M. Noirtier?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And did you also discover a bitter taste?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, doctor,” cried Barrois, “the fit is coming on
      again. Oh, do something for me.” The doctor flew to his patient.
      “That emetic, Villefort—see if it is coming.” Villefort
      sprang into the passage, exclaiming, “The emetic! the emetic!—is
      it come yet?” No one answered. The most profound terror reigned
      throughout the house. “If I had anything by means of which I could
      inflate the lungs,” said d’Avrigny, looking around him,
      “perhaps I might prevent suffocation. But there is nothing which
      would do!—nothing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sir,” cried Barrois, “are you going to let me die
      without help? Oh, I am dying! Oh, save me!”
    </p>

    <p>
      “A pen, a pen!” said the doctor. There was one lying on the
      table; he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who,
      in the midst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but
      the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them. This second
      attack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from the
      couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. The doctor left him
      in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it, and,
      going up to Noirtier, said abruptly, “How do you find yourself?—well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light
      and comfortable—eh?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had
      the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did Barrois make your lemonade?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was it M. de Villefort?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madame?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was your granddaughter, then, was it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” A groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which
      seemed to crack the very jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d’Avrigny;
      he left M. Noirtier, and returned to the sick man. “Barrois,”
      said the doctor, “can you speak?” Barrois muttered a few
      unintelligible words. “Try and make an effort to do so, my good man.”
      said d’Avrigny. Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes. “Who made
      the lemonade?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I left it in the pantry, because I was called away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who brought it into this room, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle Valentine.” D’Avrigny struck his forehead
      with his hand. “Gracious heaven,” exclaimed he. “Doctor,
      doctor!” cried Barrois, who felt another fit coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will they never bring that emetic?” asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here is a glass with one already prepared,” said Villefort,
      entering the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who prepared it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The chemist who came here with me.”

      “Drink it,” said the doctor to Barrois. “Impossible,
      doctor; it is too late; my throat is closing up. I am choking! Oh, my
      heart! Ah, my head!—Oh, what agony!—Shall I suffer like this
      long?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no, friend,” replied the doctor, “you will soon
      cease to suffer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I understand you,” said the unhappy man. “My God,
      have mercy upon me!” and, uttering a fearful cry, Barrois fell back
      as if he had been struck by lightning. D’Avrigny put his hand to his
      heart, and placed a glass before his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?” said Villefort. “Go to the kitchen and get me
      some syrup of violets.” Villefort went immediately. “Do not be
      alarmed, M. Noirtier,” said d’Avrigny; “I am going to
      take my patient into the next room to bleed him; this sort of attack is
      very frightful to witness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And taking Barrois under the arms, he dragged him into an adjoining room;
      but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade. Noirtier closed
      his right eye. “You want Valentine, do you not? I will tell them to
      send her to you.” Villefort returned, and d’Avrigny met him in
      the passage. “Well, how is he now?” asked he. “Come in
      here,” said d’Avrigny, and he took him into the chamber where
      the sick man lay. “Is he still in a fit?” said the procureur.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort drew back a few steps, and, clasping his hands, exclaimed, with
      real amazement and sympathy, “Dead?—and so soon too!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, it is very soon,” said the doctor, looking at the corpse
      before him; “but that ought not to astonish you; Monsieur and Madame
      de Saint-Méran died as soon. People die very suddenly in your house, M. de
      Villefort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” cried the magistrate, with an accent of horror and
      consternation, “are you still harping on that terrible idea?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still, sir; and I shall always do so,” replied d’Avrigny,
      “for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my
      mind; and that you may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time, listen
      well to what I am going to say, M. de Villefort.” The magistrate
      trembled convulsively. “There is a poison which destroys life almost
      without leaving any perceptible traces. I know it well; I have studied it
      in all its forms and in the effects which it produces. I recognized the
      presence of this poison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of
      Madame de Saint-Méran. There is a way of detecting its presence. It
      restores the blue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it turns
      syrup of violets green. We have no litmus-paper, but, see, here they come
      with the syrup of violets.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage. M. d’Avrigny
      opened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which
      contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed
      the door. “Look,” said he to the procureur, whose heart beat
      so loudly that it might almost be heard, “here is in this cup some
      syrup of violets, and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade
      of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook. If the lemonade be pure and
      inoffensive, the syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary, the
      lemonade be drugged with poison, the syrup will become green. Look
      closely!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter
      into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at
      the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue shade, then from
      the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal to emerald.
      Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more. The result of the experiment
      left no doubt whatever on the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,” said d’Avrigny,
      “and I will maintain this assertion before God and man.”
      Villefort said nothing, but he clasped his hands, opened his haggard eyes,
      and, overcome with his emotion, sank into a chair.

      Chapter 80. The Accusation
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. D’Avrigny
      soon restored the magistrate to consciousness, who had looked like a
      second corpse in that chamber of death. “Oh, death is in my house!”
      cried Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say, rather, crime!” replied the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. d’Avrigny,” cried Villefort, “I cannot tell
      you all I feel at this moment,—terror, grief, madness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said M. d’Avrigny, with an imposing calmness,
      “but I think it is now time to act. I think it is time to stop this
      torrent of mortality. I can no longer bear to be in possession of these
      secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally
      revenged.” Villefort cast a gloomy look around him. “In my
      house,” murmured he, “in my house!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, magistrate,” said M. d’Avrigny, “show
      yourself a man; as an interpreter of the law, do honor to your profession
      by sacrificing your selfish interests to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You make me shudder, doctor. Do you talk of a sacrifice?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you then suspect anyone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I suspect no one; death raps at your door—it enters—it
      goes, not blindfolded, but circumspectly, from room to room. Well, I
      follow its course, I track its passage; I adopt the wisdom of the
      ancients, and feel my way, for my friendship for your family and my
      respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes; well——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, speak, speak, doctor; I shall have courage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, you have in your establishment, or in your family,
      perhaps, one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces
      only one. Locusta and Agrippina, living at the same time, were an
      exception, and proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire
      ruin of the Roman empire, sullied by so many crimes. Brunhilda and
      Fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its
      infancy, when man was learning to control mind, were it even by an
      emissary from the realms of darkness. All these women had been, or were,
      beautiful. The same flower of innocence had flourished, or was still
      flourishing, on their brow, that is seen on the brow of the culprit in
      your house.” Villefort shrieked, clasped his hands, and looked at
      the doctor with a supplicating air. But the latter went on without pity:—

    <p>
      “‘Seek whom the crime will profit,’ says an axiom of
      jurisprudence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doctor,” cried Villefort, “alas, doctor, how often has
      man’s justice been deceived by those fatal words. I know not why,
      but I feel that this crime——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You acknowledge, then, the existence of the crime?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I see too plainly that it does exist. But it seems that it is
      intended to affect me personally. I fear an attack myself, after all these
      disasters.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, man,” murmured d’Avrigny, “the most selfish
      of all animals, the most personal of all creatures, who believes the earth
      turns, the sun shines, and death strikes for him alone,—an ant
      cursing God from the top of a blade of grass! And have those who have lost
      their lives lost nothing?—M. de Saint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran,
      M. Noirtier——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How? M. Noirtier?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; think you it was the poor servant’s life was coveted?
      No, no; like Shakespeare’s ‘Polonius,’ he died for
      another. It was Noirtier the lemonade was intended for—it is
      Noirtier, logically speaking, who drank it. The other drank it only by
      accident, and, although Barrois is dead, it was Noirtier whose death was
      wished for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why did it not kill my father?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de Saint-Méran’s
      death—because his system is accustomed to that very poison, and the
      dose was trifling to him, which would be fatal to another; because no one
      knows, not even the assassin, that, for the last twelve months, I have
      given M. Noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection, while the assassin
      is not ignorant, for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, have pity—have pity!” murmured Villefort, wringing
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Follow the culprit’s steps; he first kills M. de Saint-Méran——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O doctor!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would swear to it; what I heard of his symptoms agrees too well
      with what I have seen in the other cases.” Villefort ceased to
      contend; he only groaned. “He first kills M. de Saint-Méran,”
      repeated the doctor, “then Madame de Saint-Méran,—a double
      fortune to inherit.” Villefort wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead. “Listen attentively.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas,” stammered Villefort, “I do not lose a single
      word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Noirtier,” resumed M. d’Avrigny in the same pitiless
      tone,—“M. Noirtier had once made a will against you—against
      your family—in favor of the poor, in fact; M. Noirtier is spared,
      because nothing is expected from him. But he has no sooner destroyed his
      first will and made a second, than, for fear he should make a third, he is
      struck down. The will was made the day before yesterday, I believe; you
      see there has been no time lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, mercy, M. d’Avrigny!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No mercy, sir! The physician has a sacred mission on earth; and to
      fulfil it he begins at the source of life, and goes down to the mysterious
      darkness of the tomb. When crime has been committed, and God, doubtless in
      anger, turns away his face, it is for the physician to bring the culprit
      to justice.”

    <p>
      “Have mercy on my child, sir,” murmured Villefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see it is yourself who have first named her—you, her
      father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have pity on Valentine! Listen—it is impossible! I would as
      willingly accuse myself! Valentine, whose heart is pure as a diamond or a
      lily.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No pity, procureur; the crime is fragrant. Mademoiselle herself
      packed all the medicines which were sent to M. de Saint-Méran; and M. de
      Saint-Méran is dead. Mademoiselle de Villefort prepared all the cooling
      draughts which Madame de Saint-Méran took, and Madame de Saint-Méran is
      dead. Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois, who was
      sent out, the lemonade which M. Noirtier had every morning, and he has
      escaped by a miracle. Mademoiselle de Villefort is the culprit—she
      is the poisoner! To you, as the king’s attorney, I denounce
      Mademoiselle de Villefort, do your duty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doctor, I resist no longer—I can no longer defend myself—I
      believe you; but, for pity’s sake, spare my life, my honor!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. de Villefort,” replied the doctor, with increased
      vehemence, “there are occasions when I dispense with all foolish
      human circumspection. If your daughter had committed only one crime, and I
      saw her meditating another, I would say ‘Warn her, punish her, let
      her pass the remainder of her life in a convent, weeping and praying.’
      If she had committed two crimes, I would say, ‘Here, M. de
      Villefort, is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with,—one
      that has no known antidote, quick as thought, rapid as lightning, mortal
      as the thunderbolt; give her that poison, recommending her soul to God,
      and save your honor and your life, for it is yours she aims at; and I can
      picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her
      sweet exhortations. Woe to you, M. de Villefort, if you do not strike
      first!’ This is what I would say had she only killed two persons but
      she has seen three deaths,—has contemplated three murdered persons,—has
      knelt by three corpses! To the scaffold with the poisoner—to the
      scaffold! Do you talk of your honor? Do what I tell you, and immortality
      awaits you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Villefort fell on his knees. “Listen,” said he; “I have
      not the strength of mind you have, or rather that which you would not
      have, if instead of my daughter Valentine your daughter Madeleine were
      concerned.” The doctor turned pale. “Doctor, every son of
      woman is born to suffer and to die; I am content to suffer and to await
      death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Beware,” said M. d’Avrigny, “it may come slowly;
      you will see it approach after having struck your father, your wife,
      perhaps your son.”

    <p>
      Villefort, suffocating, pressed the doctor’s arm. “Listen,”
      cried he; “pity me—help me! No, my daughter is not guilty. If
      you drag us both before a tribunal I will still say, ‘No, my
      daughter is not guilty;—there is no crime in my house. I will not
      acknowledge a crime in my house; for when crime enters a dwelling, it is
      like death—it does not come alone.’ Listen. What does it
      signify to you if I am murdered? Are you my friend? Are you a man? Have
      you a heart? No, you are a physician! Well, I tell you I will not drag my
      daughter before a tribunal, and give her up to the executioner! The bare
      idea would kill me—would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out
      with my finger-nails! And if you were mistaken, doctor—if it were
      not my daughter—if I should come one day, pale as a spectre, and say
      to you, ‘Assassin, you have killed my child!’—hold—if
      that should happen, although I am a Christian, M. d’Avrigny, I
      should kill myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said the doctor, after a moment’s silence,
      “I will wait.” Villefort looked at him as if he had doubted
      his words. “Only,” continued M. d’Avrigny, with a slow
      and solemn tone, “if anyone falls ill in your house, if you feel
      yourself attacked, do not send for me, for I will come no more. I will
      consent to share this dreadful secret with you, but I will not allow shame
      and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience, as crime and misery
      will in your house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then you abandon me, doctor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, for I can follow you no farther, and I only stop at the foot
      of the scaffold. Some further discovery will be made, which will bring
      this dreadful tragedy to a close. Adieu.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I entreat you, doctor!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and
      fatal. Adieu, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One word—one single word more, doctor! You go, leaving me in
      all the horror of my situation, after increasing it by what you have
      revealed to me. But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor
      old servant?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” said M. d’Avrigny; “we will return.”
      The doctor went out first, followed by M. de Villefort. The terrified
      servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would
      pass. “Sir,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, so loud that
      all might hear, “poor Barrois has led too sedentary a life of late;
      accustomed formerly to ride on horseback, or in the carriage, to the four
      corners of Europe, the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him—his
      blood has thickened. He was stout, had a short, thick neck; he was
      attacked with apoplexy, and I was called in too late. By the way,”
      added he in a low tone, “take care to throw away that cup of syrup
      of violets in the ashes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, without shaking hands with Villefort, without adding a word to
      what he had said, went out, amid the tears and lamentations of the whole
      household. The same evening all Villefort’s servants, who had
      assembled in the kitchen, and had a long consultation, came to tell Madame
      de Villefort that they wished to leave. No entreaty, no proposition of
      increased wages, could induce them to remain; to every argument they
      replied, “We must go, for death is in this house.” They all
      left, in spite of prayers and entreaties, testifying their regret at
      leaving so good a master and mistress, and especially Mademoiselle
      Valentine, so good, so kind, and so gentle. Villefort looked at Valentine
      as they said this. She was in tears, and, strange as it was, in spite of
      the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears, he looked also at Madame
      de Villefort, and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had
      passed over her thin lips, like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously
      between two clouds in a stormy sky.

      Chapter 81. The Room of the Retired Baker
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he evening of the
      day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars’ house with
      feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance, M.
      Andrea Cavalcanti, with curled hair, moustaches in perfect order, and
      white gloves which fitted admirably, had entered the courtyard of the
      banker’s house in La Chaussée d’Antin. He had not been more
      than ten minutes in the drawing-room before he drew Danglars aside into
      the recess of a bow-window, and, after an ingenious preamble, related to
      him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father’s departure.
      He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the
      banker’s family, in which he had been received as a son, and where,
      besides, his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in
      Mademoiselle Danglars. Danglars listened with the most profound attention;
      he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days, and when
      at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on
      listening to Morcerf. He would not, however, yield immediately to the
      young man’s request, but made a few conscientious objections.
      “Are you not rather young, M. Andrea, to think of marrying?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think not, sir,” replied M. Cavalcanti; “in Italy the
      nobility generally marry young. Life is so uncertain, that we ought to
      secure happiness while it is within our reach.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir,” said Danglars, “in case your proposals,
      which do me honor, are accepted by my wife and daughter, by whom shall the
      preliminary arrangements be settled? So important a negotiation should, I
      think, be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, my father is a man of great foresight and prudence. Thinking
      that I might wish to settle in France, he left me at his departure,
      together with the papers establishing my identity, a letter promising, if
      he approved of my choice, 150,000 livres per annum from the day I was
      married. So far as I can judge, I suppose this to be a quarter of my
      father’s revenue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I,” said Danglars, “have always intended giving my
      daughter 500,000 francs as her dowry; she is, besides, my sole heiress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter
      are willing. We should command an annuity of 175,000 livres. Supposing,
      also, I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital, which is not
      likely, but still is possible, we would place these two or three millions
      in your hands, whose talent might make it realize ten per cent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never give more than four per cent, and generally only three and
      a half; but to my son-in-law I would give five, and we would share the
      profit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good, father-in-law,” said Cavalcanti, yielding to his
      low-born nature, which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic
      gloss with which he sought to conceal it. Correcting himself immediately,
      he said, “Excuse me, sir; hope alone makes me almost mad,—what
      will not reality do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Danglars, who, on his part, did not perceive how
      soon the conversation, which was at first disinterested, was turning to a
      business transaction, “there is, doubtless, a part of your fortune
      your father could not refuse you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which?” asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That you inherit from your mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Truly, from my mother, Leonora Corsinari.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How much may it amount to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, sir,” said Andrea, “I assure you I have never
      given the subject a thought, but I suppose it must have been at least two
      millions.” Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who
      finds a lost treasure, or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on
      solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir,” said Andrea, bowing to the banker respectfully,
      “may I hope?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may not only hope,” said Danglars, “but consider it
      a settled thing, if no obstacle arises on your part.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am, indeed, rejoiced,” said Andrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Danglars thoughtfully, “how is it that your
      patron, M. de Monte Cristo, did not make his proposal for you?”
      Andrea blushed imperceptibly. “I have just left the count, sir,”
      said he; “he is, doubtless, a delightful man but inconceivably
      peculiar in his ideas. He esteems me highly. He even told me he had not
      the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of
      the interest of my property. He has promised to use his influence to
      obtain it for me; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself
      the responsibility of making proposals for another, and he never would. I
      must, however, do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had
      regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion,
      because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one.
      Besides, if he will do nothing officially, he will answer any questions
      you propose to him. And now,” continued he, with one of his most
      charming smiles, “having finished talking to the father-in-law, I
      must address myself to the banker.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what may you have to say to him?” said Danglars, laughing
      in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about
      four thousand francs; but the count, expecting my bachelor’s revenue
      could not suffice for the coming month’s outlay, has offered me a
      draft for twenty thousand francs. It bears his signature, as you see,
      which is all-sufficient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bring me a million such as that,” said Danglars, “I
      shall be well pleased,” putting the draft in his pocket. “Fix
      your own hour for tomorrow, and my cashier shall call on you with a check
      for eighty thousand francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At ten o’clock then, if you please; I should like it early,
      as I am going into the country tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, at ten o’clock; you are still at the Hôtel des
      Princes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, with the banker’s usual punctuality, the
      eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man’s hands as he
      was on the point of starting, after having left two hundred francs for
      Caderousse. He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy, and
      returned as late as possible in the evening. But scarcely had he stepped
      out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” said he, “that man has been here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What man?” said Andrea carelessly, apparently forgetting him
      whom he but too well recollected.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Andrea, “my father’s old servant. Well,
      you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your excellency.” Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus
      addressed. “But,” continued the porter, “he would not
      take them.” Andrea turned pale, but as it was dark his pallor was
      not perceptible. “What? he would not take them?” said he with
      slight emotion.

    <p>
      “No, he wished to speak to your excellency; I told him you were gone
      out, and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter, which
      he had brought with him already sealed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Give it me,” said Andrea, and he read by the light of his
      carriage-lamp,—
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know where I live; I expect you tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea examined it carefully, to ascertain if the letter had been opened,
      or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was so carefully
      folded, that no one could have read it, and the seal was perfect. “Very
      well,” said he. “Poor man, he is a worthy creature.” He
      left the porter to ponder on these words, not knowing which most to
      admire, the master or the servant. “Take out the horses quickly, and
      come up to me,” said Andrea to his groom. In two seconds the young
      man had reached his room and burnt Caderousse’s letter. The servant
      entered just as he had finished. “You are about my height, Pierre,”
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have that honor, your excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You had a new livery yesterday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening,
      and do not wish to be known; lend me your livery till tomorrow. I may
      sleep, perhaps, at an inn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre obeyed. Five minutes after, Andrea left the hotel, completely
      disguised, took a cabriolet, and ordered the driver to take him to the
      Cheval Rouge, at Picpus. The next morning he left that inn as he had left
      the Hôtel des Princes, without being noticed, walked down the Faubourg
      Saint-Antoine, along the boulevard to Rue Ménilmontant, and stopping at
      the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make
      inquiry in the porter’s absence. “For whom are you looking, my
      fine fellow?” asked the fruiteress on the opposite side.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Monsieur Pailletin, if you please, my good woman,” replied
      Andrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A retired baker?” asked the fruiteress.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He lives at the end of the yard, on the left, on the third story.”
      Andrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a hare’s
      paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he pulled
      with considerable ill-temper. A moment after Caderousse’s face
      appeared at the grating in the door. “Ah, you are punctual,”
      said he, as he drew back the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Confound you and your punctuality!” said Andrea, throwing
      himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have
      flung it at the head of his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, come, my little fellow, don’t be angry. See, I have
      thought about you—look at the good breakfast we are going to have;
      nothing but what you are fond of.” Andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent
      of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him, hungry as he was; it
      was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to Provençal kitchens of an
      inferior order, added to that of dried fish, and above all, the pungent
      smell of musk and cloves. These odors escaped from two deep dishes which
      were covered and placed on a stove, and from a copper pan placed in an old
      iron pot. In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table
      prepared for two, two bottles of wine sealed, the one with green, the
      other with yellow, a supply of brandy in a decanter, and a measure of
      fruit in a cabbage-leaf, cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate.

    <p>
      “What do you think of it, my little fellow?” said Caderousse.
      “Ay, that smells good! You know I used to be a famous cook; do you
      recollect how you used to lick your fingers? You were among the first who
      tasted any of my dishes, and I think you relished them tolerably.”
      While speaking, Caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Andrea, ill-temperedly, “by my faith, if it
      was only to breakfast with you, that you disturbed me, I wish the devil
      had taken you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My boy,” said Caderousse sententiously, “one can talk
      while eating. And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see
      an old friend? I am weeping with joy.” He was truly crying, but it
      would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the
      greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the
      Pont-du-Gard. “Hold your tongue, hypocrite,” said Andrea;
      “you love me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I do, or may the devil take me. I know it is a weakness,”
      said Caderousse, “but it overpowers me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some
      trick.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said Caderousse, wiping his large knife on his apron,
      “if I did not like you, do you think I should endure the wretched
      life you lead me? Think for a moment. You have your servant’s
      clothes on—you therefore keep a servant; I have none, and am obliged
      to prepare my own meals. You abuse my cookery because you dine at the
      table d’hôte of the Hôtel des Princes, or the Café de Paris. Well, I
      too could keep a servant; I too could have a tilbury; I too could dine
      where I like; but why do I not? Because I would not annoy my little
      Benedetto. Come, just acknowledge that I could, eh?” This address
      was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand.
      “Well,” said Andrea, “admitting your love, why do you
      want me to breakfast with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That I may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our
      arrangements?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Eh, dear friend,” said Caderousse, “are wills ever made
      without codicils? But you first came to breakfast, did you not? Well, sit
      down, and let us begin with these pilchards, and this fresh butter; which
      I have put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one. Ah, yes; you
      look at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each. But
      what do you expect? This is not the Hôtel des Princes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, you are growing discontented, you are no longer happy; you,
      who only wish to live like a retired baker.” Caderousse sighed.
      “Well, what have you to say? you have seen your dream realized.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor Benedetto,
      is rich—he has an annuity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you have an annuity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have?”

    <p>
      “Yes, since I bring you your two hundred francs.” Caderousse
      shrugged his shoulders. “It is humiliating,” said he, “thus
      to receive money given grudgingly,—an uncertain supply which may
      soon fail. You see I am obliged to economize, in case your prosperity
      should cease. Well, my friend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of
      the regiment said. I know your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to
      marry the daughter of Danglars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? of Danglars?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, to be sure; must I say Baron Danglars? I might as well say
      Count Benedetto. He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a
      memory he ought to invite me to your wedding, seeing he came to mine. Yes,
      yes, to mine; gad, he was not so proud then,—he was an under-clerk
      to the good M. Morrel. I have dined many times with him and the Count of
      Morcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate
      them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong
      light.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying.
      Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the
      great gate, introduce myself. Meanwhile let us sit down and eat.”
      Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite,
      praising each dish he set before his visitor. The latter seemed to have
      resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely of the fish with
      the garlic and fat. “Ah, mate,” said Caderousse, “you
      are getting on better terms with your old landlord!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Faith, yes,” replied Andrea, whose hunger prevailed over
      every other feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So you like it, you rogue?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of
      hard living.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you see,” said Caderousse, “all my happiness is
      marred by one thought?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That I am dependent on another, I who have always gained my own
      livelihood honestly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not let that disturb you, I have enough for two.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every
      month I am tormented by remorse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good Caderousse!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So much so, that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.” Andrea
      shuddered; he always did so at Caderousse’s ideas. “It is
      miserable—do you see?—always to wait till the end of the
      month.”—“Oh,” said Andrea philosophically,
      determined to watch his companion narrowly, “does not life p</p></body></html>
