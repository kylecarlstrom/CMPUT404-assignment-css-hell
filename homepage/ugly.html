                Hi, I'm Kyle Carlstrom. I'm a Computing Science student at the University of Alberta.
                When I'm not busy coding I enjoy snowboarding and hiking. Travelling is a passion of mine
                and you can usually find me browsing travel forums looking for the next cool place to see.

                <p>
                    I am in my final year of studies at the University of Alberta and worked on projects in a variety
                    of fields including mobile app development, machine learning, and assembly. Last year, I worked at
                    Intuit doing a 12 month internship. I learned a ton about web development while I was there including
                    JavaScript, CSS, and HTML but also front-end frameworks including React, Redux, and Relay.
